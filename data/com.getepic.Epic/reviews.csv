29b4a0cb-9006-4f26-a990-9c5dd553f488,A Google user,I'm having the same issue as all these other people in that I've subscribed to the yearly plan but am unable to access the full version. I've tried from my son's account and my own account. Thank goodness the play store automatically refunds my subscription if I don't sign in the app within 3 days. All troubleshooting emails via the app have gone unanswered in over a week. My son loves using the app at school and is very disappointed he can't continue to read his books when he gets home.,1,18,3.137.2,2024-11-19 16:32:46

But when I tried to activate the free subscription option the fields were all blank and I got sent into endless loop. Is there a software update for this app?

Like ik I haven't used epic in a while but then when I download it says something about a free trial like I said I'm not Rich. Me and my family are trying to buy house so we're on a budget and now ur telling us we need a free trial?,1,4,,2023-07-25 14:46:48

His teacher used it as one of the ways she tracked the books he was reading. He is now in 3rd grade but still struggles to read and write. I love the fact he can use the much on his ipad to talk and search for topics. I got the Unlimited for him to use and connected his school account to it as well. So I can recommend books my son would like and his teacher can too. Love this app,5,36,3.79.4,2022-11-30 06:02:23

815452a8-fd4d-4b55-b722-08d1dc5118ca,A Google user,I had a recurring subscription. Even though this was on auto pay the subscription showed as lapsed in the app and put me from Epic unlimited back to Epic basic. When I contacted Epic support they were utterly unable to assist and then proceeded to make inaccurate claims about payments on my account. Their only proposed resolution was that I cancel my Google play subscription and subscribe directly with them. Its a shame to ruin a great product with laughably bad support and issue resolution.,1,33,3.76.2,2022-10-24 08:07:30

596c0e93-f486-48b1-a2c8-4ad9d081cc56,A Google user,There are tons of books but epic really fails at searching for a book or assigning books based on reading level. Every kid has access to ALL the books. No way to select only books in their reading level which means they have a hard time a accessing books they can actually read. At least this is our experience and we are new to the app/sight. They have the ability to search by different types of guided reading levels but then nothing comes up or very little.,3,30,3.67.2,2022-09-01 07:28:34

I noticed that the only kinds of books you can read without a subscription are small stories and there is basically nothing for more advanced readers. I feel like this app would just be better if they added more readable books without a subscription or added adds that are age appropriate for kids,3,4,,2022-06-26 22:08:58

We have 5 boys and homeschool, and it was great, but unfortunately (I know this is a touchy subject, but everyone is different) we don't want the LGBTQ stuff. Little kids shouldn't be taught about any type of sexuality. They should be reading about animals, and silly stories. If there was an option to opt out of that stuff, I'm sure me and other people would love to stay with Epic. But unfortunately there is no option!",1,15,3.59.2,2022-06-17 21:23:16

I select to log in using my password (for a plan I already paid). I select a parent log in. It asks me to create a kid account. Then it returnse to the original screen advertising payment plans!

I've paid for access to the full library for 3 months but was only given basic privileges. I've contacted customer service several times and gave proof of purchase but no one will respond to me. The app store won't refund my purchase so I had no choice but to cancel with my issue unresolved.,1,34,3.58.2,2022-06-06 12:36:20

I really would wish for someone to put in books about Mrbeast and The DreamSMP because kids like me need a wide variety of things to keep up to date on! So that is just a suggestion that I hope you would follow through with! Thank you! there is one thing I am not a fan of... So If I Sign up to Read 1 Book after school hours I get an Avatar. I dont like the Balloon pop at the end of a book. I think there should be a level up! thx bye!!!,5,80,3.57.1,2022-05-21 09:50:36

And whenever you try to search something nothing really comes up and if you do find stuff most of the time it's unlimited and I'm not paying that much money just to read a book and also why do you need pick one book a day if you can fix this thanks.,3,3,3.54.0,2022-05-05 12:58:22

My son is only 2 so we don't use any of the features the app offers. I kind of wish there was a ""lite"" version that was ONLY the books for me to read him. I don't feel as if I get my $13 a month out of it but that's okay because I do enjoy having a huge library for him at my finger tips anywhere I go.
