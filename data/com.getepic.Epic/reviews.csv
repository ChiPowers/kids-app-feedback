But when I let my son use it, he inevitably ends up only doing Read-To-Me (RTM), consuming the content passively instead of actually reading. I know that the application has a button to pause the RTM feature. Unfortunately, my son would never use this button when I'm not around. The problem is that the application lacks the parental control to *permanently* disable this irresistible AV media feature. I challenge the developers to add such an option to the app",2,34,3.137.2,2024-10-09 20:38:45

How is the only way to contact them is via sending a help request but no customer service number? Also how do you withdraw someone's money but not allow them to use it. Please resolve by either fully refunding my money/cancelling my subscription or reinstate my subscription since you have my money.,1,8,3.127.0,2024-02-16 11:38:02

His teacher used it as one of the ways she tracked the books he was reading. He is now in 3rd grade but still struggles to read and write. I love the fact he can use the much on his ipad to talk and search for topics. I got the Unlimited for him to use and connected his school account to it as well.

They just found out that they added books that are not appropriate for Catholics/Christians students. As much as I want to blame the school, I think it's my fault for trusting them and not checking Epic 1st myself. Now I just have a PAID subscription that we won't use. No refunds either.

815452a8-fd4d-4b55-b722-08d1dc5118ca,A Google user,I had a recurring subscription. Even though this was on auto pay the subscription showed as lapsed in the app and put me from Epic unlimited back to Epic basic. When I contacted Epic support they were utterly unable to assist and then proceeded to make inaccurate claims about payments on my account. Their only proposed resolution was that I cancel my Google play subscription and subscribe directly with them. Its a shame to ruin a great product with laughably bad support and issue resolution.,1,33,3.76.2,2022-10-24 08:07:30

596c0e93-f486-48b1-a2c8-4ad9d081cc56,A Google user,There are tons of books but epic really fails at searching for a book or assigning books based on reading level. Every kid has access to ALL the books. No way to select only books in their reading level which means they have a hard time a accessing books they can actually read. At least this is our experience and we are new to the app/sight. They have the ability to search by different types of guided reading levels but then nothing comes up or very little.,3,30,3.67.2,2022-09-01 07:28:34

We have 5 boys and homeschool, and it was great, but unfortunately (I know this is a touchy subject, but everyone is different) we don't want the LGBTQ stuff. Little kids shouldn't be taught about any type of sexuality. They should be reading about animals, and silly stories. If there was an option to opt out of that stuff, I'm sure me and other people would love to stay with Epic. But unfortunately there is no option!",1,15,3.59.2,2022-06-17 21:23:16

I have attempted to cancel both thru the app and by email since March several times. Epic has never responded except with an auto reply and recently (May 5) charged me an annual renewal. Customer service is non existent! Being billed for service I can't cancel! Update: Issue has now been resolved. Always amazes me how a bad online review obtains quick action.,2,14,3.54.0,2022-05-10 09:22:04

My favoirite thing about Epic is being able to find age appropriate nonfiction books for my younger kids. Not to mention all the fiction books that can be found too. My little ones who can't read very well yet can have many of the books read aloud to them. There are also lots of audio books & videos too. There's still nothing like holding an actual book in your hand, but this is the next best thing when you don't live in town.",5,133,,2022-02-02 12:33:36

3f1d05ca-3037-462a-8b8f-af86ca66b7ba,Lana N,"""Unlimited reading and learning"" Yeah right. More than HALF of the stuff is unavailable unless you got what I call VIP membership. Like literally! All the videos are unlimited! Most of the books unlimited! I like Nellie Nutgraf but only, ONLY ONE book it not unlimited! Same with cat ninja expect you can read like only 7 out of about 12 books. Don't install this unless you want to pay or you like only reading like less than HALF of the books. Other than that great app. Please fix problems though.",2,9,3.39.2,2022-01-25 23:10:04

2fff5ae3-5995-4cd5-8347-629a9fcbbea7,K S,EPIC is the bbest reading app for all ages and if you cant read they have atuo books for people and if you dont like it you can read the book by your self and your teacher or parent can assign a book to you if she would think you would like it.I am 11 years old and epic makes it so easy to read books and I am not a very good reader so most of the time I read auto books and I am on level 23 and it is amasing I recamend epic for ages 4 and up this is the best app ever.
