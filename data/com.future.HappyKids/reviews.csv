We found the app on our tv and I fell in love then went and downloaded it on my daughter's firestick. I love the way it's set up by age groups. I often babysit a 6 month old and like that it has a spot for younger children who just need bright colors. My girls are two years apart 4 and 6 and I'm able to easily go to a section of shows appropriate for their ages with things of their intrest. Hardly any commercials.
