The content itself is recycled over and over again with the rewards nerfed. And balancing has been a wash ever since they decided to overhaul characters and its entire system. Rather than try and create content that is genuinely enjoyable (note, enjoyable -- the core thing of a game), now it's all about creating mechanics that simply exist for the sake of creating characters to counter-said new mechanics. The tactic as of late is to simply introduce a problem and slow players down for not having said new units -- which just isn't enjoyable at all. The game is more generous than other gachapon games and this is a fact, however, the units themselves have no meaningful value as Nintendo/Cygames have now gotten themselves into a cycle of creating new units in order to fill the niche content they make. If you're looking for a long term gachapon game, avoid this like you would with the rest of them. You can find much more meaningful things to do with your time.

My last review really complained about the filter system for Wyrmprints, and what do I find one day while team building? A fixed filter system. Add on top of it the ever evolving gameplay, and there's going to be years of content to come. Most people seem upset at some sort of cut in Wyrmite (The game's limited currency). Personally, I didn't notice it. However, these kinds of concerns are legitimate, and I'm sure the Dragalia team will address them, just like all of the other issues that have cropped up in the past. For instance, we used to have to summon for Wyrmprints, this not only made the summon pool more diluted, it also falsely got our hopes up when we saw the legendary rainbow summon circle. The dev team noticed, and changed it. Wyrmprints were moved to loot drops. But that was still too rare for a fundamental item to the game, so the devs again changed it so that we could use eldwater to buy them from the shop. This was AGAIN changed with the latest update, now, you can just buy a single copy of each Wyrmprint, and then worry about getting more copies and upgrading them in their own menu, instead of having to keep track of what Wyrmprints you have, how many you have, and how many you need to buy. TL:DR: If it's broken right now, send in a report asking for a fix, the dev team will get to it.",5,30,2.2.0,2020-12-02 23:07:59,1350,-0.8546,neutral,72.0096153846154,True,True,-1,0.0,,Unknown,False

b6c58a22-cca3-4e6d-b872-db0c2ed5dab7,A Google user,"This game has a lot of positives that has kept me playing since it came out. 1. The game gives a lot of free gacha chances. When you don't get what you want, it compensates pretty well. 2. There are 4 resources in this game. Gold, eldwater, Wyrmite, and Diamantium (paid). Gold is used for everything, and at the start I was always needing more. Eldwater is the compensation for ""failed"" gacha rolls, which is also necessary for upgrading units. This is my most sought after resource as you need a LOT. Wyrmite is the free currency used for gacha rolls. Diamantium is the paid currency for gacha rolls. The resource separation is very good for a gacha game. 3. The story is good and the artwork is good. Many waifu's for all. 4. This game has a lobby system for harder content. You can premake teams and challenge fights together. Recent changes where you can buff up your multiplayer character have been very nice. 5. Even the worst characters can be upgraded to equal, better, or on par with the hardest to get characters. This is NOT a pay to win. Negatives - 1. This game is so grindy you'll spend weeks really not doing anything but burning your stamina and waiting for an event that has something useful. Then something will release and you'll wish you had used your time grinding the other option that you ignored. 2. Ultra hard content takes time to put together and is not for the casual player. 3.

What isn't fantastic is the random chance for every update to basically brick my game, keeping me stuck at the ""tap to start"" screen, making me reinstall and redownload the 5+ GIGABITES in updates, destroying my data plan (which I have to share with 4 other people). Coupled with that, is frequent crashes and freezes, leading to app restarts. Furthermore, the ""might suggestion"" is way off, as I struggle to beat a quest with a recommended might of 5,000 with my team with 23,000 might. I'm way to stupid to get weapon progression right, so I'm more or less stuck hoping the combinations I'm doing are working out, which basically leads me to beating my head against the wall. Now, with more positive stuff about the game. Aside from a severe difficulty spike, the gameplay is really simple and fun, with many quests able to be run on auto so you can set it down when you need to grind. Also the game is fairly generous, I've gotten most adventurers and I haven't had to spend a single cent (although at the time of this writing, I still don't have Tiki, one of the only FE collab characters I wanted).

This game is a true MMO-lite, offering plentiful currency and frequent updates. You can easily earn more than 100 pulls a month by playing for a few hours a week. I have trouble playing other Gatcha games because of how much currency this game gives away. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I'm serious. The banner model is also very comfortable, with limited-time units being the minority. I won't claim that Dragalia Lost has great rates, but the sheer amount of free currency and pity system will give you a real shot at the featured units, without needing to buy any pulls. The game gets updated monthly with new campaign chapters or additional endgame bosses. There are occasional content droughts, but these are filled with event reruns offering great rewards or reward weeks offering double quest rewards. . The content itself is also quality. There are some reskinned bosses, but most of them offer a unique set of gimmicks/mechanics. There is some overlap among units, but all 4* and 5* units are reasonably unique with very few cases of one unit being flat out better than another. There is enough unit and equipment variety to offer depth without being intimidating. Auto-play (now with auto repeat) and skip tickets (auto complete) are avalible for most stages in the game (after being completed) outside of endgame modes.
