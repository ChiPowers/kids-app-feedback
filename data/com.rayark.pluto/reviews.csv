There is some additional songs you can get but the base game has so many bangers that it's not even necessary.

But after I heard the music, I was overhelmed by so much positive feelings, i felt so much work and heart, that were given to each song. Also art and story are amazing, drawn very accurately and pictures also have such sweet feelings, when studing them. However even though the game is great, paying for 10 books 40$ is too much, I would give 23$ for it, but hey it's just an opinion of a stranger. Still good job Rayark.",4,0,1.5.2,2021-09-20 16:37:42

The base game allows you to play through the story and nets you 4 song collections as you progress with more song packs available to buy.

The music in Deemo is much softer than Cytus but it fits the heartbreaking story. The major downside to this game is the overall price of all the paid collections of songs that Rayark added to the game. Realistically speaking the main game only has 4 collections of songs that are completely free while 4 collections require purchasing the Forgotten Hourglass feature which allows multiple playthroughs of the game.,3,8,4.0.0,2021-02-04 01:15:54

If you're in an area where the network is jumpy there might be slight off syncing with the game and the music but just restart your songs and you'll be back to normal. Otherwise, if you're in a steady network area you'll have no problems. I highly recommend this to everyone. It's better than Angry Birds, all sim games and a thousand times revolutionary than the Smule Magic Piano.",5,4,3.2.0,2020-10-26 07:14:48

Not a bad game but not really good either. The music are great but even if you pay for full game not all music you can get for free. So I think the game is getting overestimated by its fanbase. Rather watch the movie deemo than play this game.Quite disappointed because it one of the few game that i paid for full version.",3,1,3.7.3,2020-06-20 17:59:33

The songs are all extremely slow, and the skill ceiling practically merges with the floor at some points.

This game is down right amazing the animation is beautiful, some I have never seen, and the music it's self is just one adventure after another. The game guides you through a touching story which most games can't even compare to. Little to no ads and even when there is the artwork makes you forget.

It's especially bad on higher note count songs like magnolia when you have to tap so quickly in a row it doesn't see any of it. Even if i tap far faster than needed it doesn't do anything. Its messing with my score badly! The problem still hasn't been adressed and it's ruining end-game songs. Please fix. I messed with calibration settings, trying different songs, playing with slower speeds to try to fix it but nothing helped.

265520bd-283e-4c63-9843-4e21b9754049,A Google user,"Edit: Upon playing the game for a bit more, I realised that I very heavily dislike the gameplay. It is incredibly difficult to be accurate just by sight and so much information is simply not given such as how long the song is, what judgements/timings you get, a running accuracy percentage among other things. The story was someone cliché although just going around the tree house and other areas was fun as well as seeing different characters dialogue. Overall, a rhythm game with less enjoyable gameplay is not a very good game no matter what but it was enjoyable to play through in the day or two I played it, not for long term or high level play. A lot of the music was especially nice as well.",4,4,3.2.1,2018-10-21 06:14:31
