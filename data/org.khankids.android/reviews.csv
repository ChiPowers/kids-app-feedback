I think the regular khan academy app is boring because it doesn't have any fun characters and uses actual people. I like to use the khan kids for my daughters in grades 8 and 12.

My grandson will be four in January and I don't even remember how I discovered this app but I found it like a year or so ago and at first I helped him navigate it. Even then he loved it. Now that he's older and does so good on the phones and his tablet by his self he truly loves this app. It's fun and engaging and super educational. We love all the games and characters and especially the little videos! He loves getting his rewards and then playing with them in their rooms. ❤️❤️,5,141,7.0,2024-09-09 16:36:26

b1c1c24e-5767-4a05-8e9b-3e2733930150,A Google user,I've always been wary of my small babies being on any screen outside of a few kid movies or educational shows. However I cut out my 3y/o's nap time just a month ago and realized that the downtime that the nap provided me was gone with it. So I did some quick research on good apps for toddlers and this came up. Now me and my toddler spend a good 30 minutes on this with me by her side helping her. It gives me some time to just sit and it really helps her practice what I teach her separately.,5,85,6.4,2024-07-25 21:51:15

The thing is, I would love to have an option of switching between two or more languages, since she is learning both English and French, and the only option now it seems is for the app to be set up in one language without an option to switch to another, so as to keep the learning going.

Is Khan Academy interested in including speech learning. Showing a human face making letter and word sounds will likely help my son speak.

The only feedback I hope the developers can address is when moving up years, the same lessons she completed from younger age groups are repeated, which is putting her off using the app due to excessive repetition. I wish that when you complete a lesson, it is completed at all age groups. I.e. she has done all 3 ""opposite"" lessons, but they are not ticked at the next age up.",5,192,5.1.1,2022-09-09 20:07:25

The kids love being able to choose content from the ""library."" The learning path is creatively designed. (: The kids love the ""gifts""! (: I'm happy we can turn the music off - some apps don't let you mute the music, which can become distracting when trying to learn. The interface is very intuitive! The best part - it's free!

As this is an app for kids there is no need to include these things in the stories for kids. The app was better off without including the LGBT things. Very disappointed. Such a fine app this used to be but now the propaganda for these things has started to creep into kids educational apps even.",1,28,5.1,2022-08-04 13:24:34

For us, introducing 4 year olds to trans concepts is inappropriate and unacceptable. Upon googling, KAK openly supports lgbtq+ values as a company and it shows in some of the stories, so it isn't a good fit for our family and feel it is confusing for young children instead of helpful.",2,6,4.3,2022-06-30 22:54:23

The reason for my star rating is due to the amount of silly song YouTube videos that are played in the lessons. In my opinion it is excessive and overstimulating for younger children. I do hope some changes can be made to limit video watching and be replaced more audio interactions.,2,2,,2022-06-29 13:48:48

Most days are a struggle as I have 2 different learners; so what one thinks is great, the other is having a total melt down even trying to understand. So when we hit a rough patch I immediately turn to Khan! KHAN is fun and engaging and my kids have retained so much information, I can quiz them on things they learned 2 weeks ago and they recall it immediately! TRY IT!
