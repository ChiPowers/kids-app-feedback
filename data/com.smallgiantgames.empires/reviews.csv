You will see a lot of negative reviews claiming the game is pay to win, that's nonsense.

Star Wars heroes offer x4 speed for free and they are made by EA. Get with it. Lame pay to win game and even then you can't win. Might as well be a game in a casino.

Coming back to it with the dragons .. it's like the game has made things intentionally impossible. Progression isn't possible so it's easy to lose interest. And the chances to summon anything other than a hero already in my herodex is disgustingly embarrassing. Not worth playing anymore. and the cost for event heroes are increasing yet you never end up getting the special heroes.. you get the same average heroes you already have,1,31,77.0.0,2025-05-22 09:23:53

As enticing as it is to spend money on this game, you don't have to spend a dime to get good heroes.",4,33,76.1.0,2025-04-24 05:35:26

(You're a phone game not. pc/ consol game) today I was forced to get an update I currently can't afford to do because of a full memory on my phone. suddenly this year there's an update almost every 3-5 weeks. and the memory is always depleted because of it. I can't even get in now to check my daily status or challenges. sigh smh bye I guess,1,14,76.0.0,2025-04-23 20:05:41

I believe the game has become a pay to win since the only way to pull good heroes is by purchasing .. can't imagine the game doesn't appreciate almost 2 hours of playing each day and not getting anything worthy in return,3,20,75.0.1,2025-04-03 05:43:20

20524b72-0c00-47c5-ac9f-7bcd56facb8f,A Google user,Fun game but the Raid matchup power levels of opponents are not accurate at all. You can be shown to be hundreds of points higher than your opponent but if they have one of the massively OP 5* characters it won't matter. You can kill the entire team with only the 5* left and have that one character TPK your entire party 4* characters single handedly. The 5* characters almost never drop as part of the summons either. If you want one you usually have to buy them or enough crystals to spawn summon.,3,0,75.0.1,2025-04-01 13:32:34

Thus I've spent way too much money on gems just to get enough food to even level up characters.

Leveling heroes & troops are ridiculous. Spend 40 bundles of food on a 4☆troop, just to change that troop for a 5☆ for another 40 bundle of food. Enticing as it may be, not worth the ink that made them. To get decent heroes you need to pay to play to get. Don't be fooled by Dragonshire. Not finished.

I'm playing this game more then 5 years now and I still don't even got a decent 5 star team to defend my base, let that sink in. Maybe it's because I'm refusing to spend allot of $$$...

There are almost 1000 heroes, most of which are obsolete at higher levels of play. This means that the $$$ spent to level them is down the drain. Some players spend thousands/month, so if you get into a competitive mood it is very costly to catch up. MANY top players have quit the game in the last year or so. It's so bad that top alliances can't find players.",1,404,69.0.1,2025-01-30 03:35:41

I am at 3000 team strength and it keeps matching me against guys in similar trophy range but they have team strengths of 3500 to 5000 so I have no chance to beat them. WORST problem.

The game used to be good years ago but due to different direction all they care about is releasing over powered new heros for cash grabs as the player base continues to die due to all the decisions they made for profit instead of balancing &serving players,1,11,72.1.0,2024-12-08 14:23:06

Before you could get an epic coin ever so often, not anymore. They also changed it so you get a chance of a 5 star with training. I don't recommend this game.

Unfortunately as time progressed they got greedy and have constantly changed it in order to make more money off of you. Your tiles are not random and you will always have more of your weaker tiles. Unless you spend a lot of money any relevant 5* you get will not be finished before some newer more powerful characters come out. The chances of getting decent characters have shrunk pretty drastically over the years. It's sad.,1,10,71.0.1,2024-11-01 15:25:27

But in this game you will never get a x30 summon without spending a lot of money. Gems are hard to come by and even watching a Ad will get you a single gem. It cost 350 for a single pull and you aren't even guaranteed a good one.

Even the in-game purchases suck, with the majority of what is obtained from p2p are the low value characters and items you'd receive after months of waiting for f2p growth.

All strong heroes are locked away behind pay screens with ludicrously low drop rates. The strongest troops are only available in portals with low drop rates that you can only get by paying. Everything is geared toward players who spend literally 1000s of $ every week. This is what it takes to get a half decent team. This developer deserves bankruptcy.",1,24,68.0.5,2024-08-12 05:33:51

(By far the best way to gain materials) The leveling of heroes makes sense in the beginning, but it just becomes a grind after the first few. The start of the game is nice, and balanced. Once you reach the final state of the game however, the heroes become overpowered and don't make sense to combat, unless you feel free to pay.

I hope you go bankrupt. This is nothing more than greed. You cannot even pretend to be competitive unless you are willing to spend literally thousands of dollars on a regular basis. Which somehow players do. This is gambling for game content and they are exploiting this personality trait.

Before that getting 3 star character or higher was so much harder to get which was quite annoying. Nowadays I play the game everyday because there's a lot things to do. If you want more rewards I suggest to claim daily gifts. I couldn't give 5/5 because it's past. (Chances of getting 5 star is so small) 😥,4,23,68.0.3,2024-07-09 08:32:39

Also, there are times they like to have you win raids with 5 of one color, go to do one and the color you need, doesn't show up so you will get your butt kicked, badly. Games are supposed to be relaxing, not stressing you out.",1,32,67.1.0,2024-05-28 02:59:18

However, the creators of this game absolutely LOVE to change the ""balance"" of powers, so the heroes you have continue to lose powers.

I contacted customer support several times to resolve, but it's just AI customer support with no opportunity for escalation. I continued playing the game at -7000 gems, and simply figured that I just wouldn't be buying anything else. Now, 3 weeks later, I get a message from the developer that if I don't get my gems out of the negative, they will ban me. That's insane",1,12,65.0.1,2024-03-19 16:39:14
dde04a99-1279-4805-a003-b189960b6eaa,Jackie Carew,This is a great game. It doesn't flood you with ads like other games tend to do. It is getting hard to play without playing if you aren't spending money but you can still play without investing money into it. If you're a competitive person or laid back there are different options within the game to accommodate you. Some of the play is mindless but others you have to think/strategize. Make friends and alliances.,5,53,65.0.1,2024-03-19 15:57:13

The luck of the spin is equal yes, but the heroes ppl are spinning for aren't. In the time it take F2P to properly train a 5*, newer heros would be introduced. This is an issue because newer heros aren't created equal to prior heroes. Point is, we aren't grinding to get stronger, we are grinding to stay relevant and in that case f2p gets punished.

All the players know about, and we laugh at just how bad it is. We keep asking for a monthly fee so they can make the tile drop ACTUALLY RANDOM. 5 tiles mean a 20% drop rate for tiles. I went 82 tiles without getting a blue tile. That is like winning Powerball twice in a row. The Whales actually get the 20% tile drop ratio. It is a scam.",1,13,64.0.2,2024-02-25 06:07:46
