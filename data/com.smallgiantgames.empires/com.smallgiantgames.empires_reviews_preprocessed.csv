20524b72-0c00-47c5-ac9f-7bcd56facb8f,A Google user,Fun game but the Raid matchup power levels of opponents are not accurate at all. You can be shown to be hundreds of points higher than your opponent but if they have one of the massively OP 5* characters it won't matter. You can kill the entire team with only the 5* left and have that one character TPK your entire party 4* characters single handedly. The 5* characters almost never drop as part of the summons either. If you want one you usually have to buy them or enough crystals to spawn summon.,3,0,75.0.1,2025-04-01 13:32:34,neutral,-0.1797,66.25300000000001,500,False,False,-1,5,Other,False

bae0d20e-b32c-411f-974f-9426c6a23111,A Google user,Great game. THREE problems: Too many ads on main screen and raid matching goes off trophies of opponent rather than comparable team strength. I am at 3000 team strength and it keeps matching me against guys in similar trophy range but they have team strengths of 3500 to 5000 so I have no chance to beat them. WORST problem. It's very hard to get good characters and you often get the same good character which seems highly flawed.
