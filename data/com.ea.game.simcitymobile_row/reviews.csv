It's honestly quite boring because you don't get to actually interact or do anything with the actual Sims in your town. This one is about building and expanding the town only, but it's very difficult to build enough coins to actually buy all of the different stations and the schools one needs (such as making sure every home is protected by police and a fire station).

6005a789-276b-45fa-91a9-74b1c8744ede,A Google user,I have been playing this game for more then 10 years and i had no complaints about the game itself till now. I have to say that your last update sucks. My guild mates all think about quitting this game because it's not fun anymore. What was fun before now it's a full time job. We all like how that game was before because it didn't took to much time of our lifes and still managed to do something in our cities. So ... prepare for mass quiting if you don't change the game to the past update.,1,1,1.66.1.140467,2025-07-20 07:44:08

While the artstyle is very good and original, it's essentially a grind-fest disguised as a simulation game. Everything requires a lot of devotion, without any real reward for your time. Also, all the produce takes (at least for me) too long, so much so, that I seriously think the times under the 4x booster should be the normal times.

I recently upgraded my phone and had space on it to ""enjoy"" one of my all-time favorite games. Very quickly I realized that this is no longer enjoyable (nor is it free). I used to appreciate being able to play for days and manage to build a substantial city before ""pay to play"" was necessary. Apparently, that is not something that the creators appreciate. It is so ridiculously obvious how the game is ""set-up"". Prepare to pay or uninstall.",1,8,1.66.1.140467,2025-07-08 09:18:49

The new released created a new game, limited to time consumption, ""engagement"" and shortermism profit/ monetization.

Instead you are given the buildings in the one-dimensional line of progression. Basically you just log in every few minutes, tap building, build new building. No challenge or reward for planning and thinking. Thanks EA..",1,2,1.65.1.138911,2025-06-20 05:09:50

Further, it takes several minutes just to get to gameplay when you open the app. You are bombarded with offer after offer, ""news and alerts,"" and deceitful pop ups that pop up while collecting items. They can't get you to spend money so they try to trick you into accidentally clicking an offer. EA and devs, you are terrible people.",1,1,1.65.1.138911,2025-06-05 07:09:00

It should be simpler to earn this last region. In the early years of the game gaining the assets needed to build buildings was uncomplicated. That has changed, the longer you play the harder it is to acquire those building assets. This has reduced the fun of the game which is building cities.

To SimCity BuildIt developers, I love the game, but please update older residential buildings to include visible citizens. Many feel ""soulless"" without any activity, making zoomed-in areas look empty. Even subtle animations would bring much-needed life. Also, Omega residential homes lack variety and visible citizens.

How game forces you too watch ads. citizens are annoying and often repeat the same senteces. But biggest issue is making money because taxes take way too long.

I can't play certain parts of the game because they start right before I go to bed and end before I wake up. I have also lost out on rewards for things I have done in the game but apparently since I was asleep I wasn't able to collect my rewards and lost out on them. So I put in all that time for nothing.

Once again they think live service games full of micro transactions is the answer. I'm going to laugh when EA falls because of this or is at least retreats out of the gaming industry.

45a1a88b-4169-4ed3-9dec-20075f4e805a,A Google user,in my personal opinion I would say I have been playing this game for years and the game is a great tool for a pass time and there is a lot to do In the game so you can play at anytime whilst selling items to your neighbouring cities/ friends.....if I had to say there is a problem it would be that the global market doesn't allow you to individually search what item you want that other cities are selling.... I would recommend this game as I have enjoyed playing it.,5,21,1.63.0.137021,2025-04-09 12:01:09

The constant upgrade request icon is annoying when I don’t want to upgrade, making the city look cluttered and causing accidental clicks.

0244e56f-62de-4340-b04c-8da3ebe85540,A Google user,Game started out great. Now it is tedious. So many different items are needed to level up objects/port/airport etc when there is not enough space to store it all. I try to sell stuff but nobody buys it (esp the useless beach/mountain stuff) so I spend simcash to delete it. I don't get enough to expand storage unless you use real money. I don't know how to get the relevant items to start club wars and the epic projects are unattainable. Total waste of time. I prefer the original 90s game!,2,22,1.63.0.137021,2025-04-03 16:17:31

No matter which feature or operation you click on, the game keeps buffering, which disrupts the flow and makes it frustrating to play. The graphics and overall interface are well-designed, but this loading issue seriously affects gameplay. The developers need to fix this problem to improve the user experience.

Moreover we lose those items as well from the City Storage.

Services should work dynamically via roads, covering all connected buildings for more realism. To keep it balanced, the cost of these buildings could be raised. This would enhance gameplay, reduce the hassle of placement, and make city-building feel immersive and strategic. I hope the developers consider this improvement in future updates.",4,1,1.62.1.135396,2025-03-20 18:22:03

9104fdaa-cb84-40b3-bda8-6128524c48f4,Lum Cheong,Good to play and bring back some memory. But too much of ads and too much time to spend and wait. Which is typical type of game to make you spend for the game. Come too much of element / side game apart fromt the SIM city itself. Perhaps another trick to get you spend more? But overall the graphic was nice design. Can be better if back to the origin of SIM city some years ago.,3,46,1.61.1.134631,2025-02-20 01:39:13

Even building the most basic houses can require items built from buildings at 5, 10, and 20-minute wait times. Unless you pay real money. Then it's fun. I guess it would cost $30-$50 to have about an hours fun, not having to wait exorbitant amounts of time to progress... If you're happy paying that, then it's a great game. If you live in the real world, see it for what it is. Tap tap for 5 minutes, then come back in an hour...",2,10,1.61.1.134631,2025-02-19 09:14:46
