I have to say that your last update sucks. My guild mates all think about quitting this game because it's not fun anymore. What was fun before now it's a full time job. We all like how that game was before because it didn't took to much time of our lifes and still managed to do something in our cities. So ... prepare for mass quiting if you don't change the game to the past update.,1,1,1.66.1.140467,2025-07-20 07:44:08

Starts off fine but like everything else it shifts your focus and limits you from making any progress towards building the city. There are over 6 different currencies or 'things needed' to collect, keys, coins etc and obviously the good stuff isn't available with the main game currency that you collect as your population grows.

Instead you are given the buildings in the one-dimensional line of progression. Basically you just log in every few minutes, tap building, build new building. No challenge or reward for planning and thinking. Thanks EA..",1,2,1.65.1.138911,2025-06-20 05:09:50

They have made this game 100% pay to play. Further, it takes several minutes just to get to gameplay when you open the app. You are bombarded with offer after offer, ""news and alerts,"" and deceitful pop ups that pop up while collecting items. They can't get you to spend money so they try to trick you into accidentally clicking an offer. EA and devs, you are terrible people.",1,1,1.65.1.138911,2025-06-05 07:09:00

It should be simpler to earn this last region. In the early years of the game gaining the assets needed to build buildings was uncomplicated. That has changed, the longer you play the harder it is to acquire those building assets. This has reduced the fun of the game which is building cities.

To SimCity BuildIt developers, I love the game, but please update older residential buildings to include visible citizens. Many feel ""soulless"" without any activity, making zoomed-in areas look empty. Even subtle animations would bring much-needed life. Also, Omega residential homes lack variety and visible citizens.

I have also lost out on rewards for things I have done in the game but apparently since I was asleep I wasn't able to collect my rewards and lost out on them. So I put in all that time for nothing.

Once again they think live service games full of micro transactions is the answer. I'm going to laugh when EA falls because of this or is at least retreats out of the gaming industry.

I would recommend this game as I have enjoyed playing it.,5,21,1.63.0.137021,2025-04-09 12:01:09

Pay to win for club wars and contest of mayors 2. Growing your city from the beginning is fun but as it gets bigger, it becomes a problem cause crafting takes longer 3. Lots of times you'll experience missing items to complete an action 4. Massive battery drainer 5. They do nothing with cheaters, there are people cheating to get SimCash",1,2,1.63.0.137021,2025-04-07 20:36:59

The constant upgrade request icon is annoying when I don’t want to upgrade, making the city look cluttered and causing accidental clicks.

0244e56f-62de-4340-b04c-8da3ebe85540,A Google user,Game started out great. Now it is tedious. So many different items are needed to level up objects/port/airport etc when there is not enough space to store it all. I try to sell stuff but nobody buys it (esp the useless beach/mountain stuff) so I spend simcash to delete it. I don't get enough to expand storage unless you use real money. I don't know how to get the relevant items to start club wars and the epic projects are unattainable. Total waste of time. I prefer the original 90s game!,2,22,1.63.0.137021,2025-04-03 16:17:31

I don't want to vote if the two are non appealing. It would also be nice to take a bigger picture of your blueprint instead of a small portion. my phone can take a better picture. 🙄,1,2,1.62.1.135396,2025-03-24 15:23:12

However, one major issue ruins the experience – the constant loading and buffering. No matter which feature or operation you click on, the game keeps buffering, which disrupts the flow and makes it frustrating to play. The graphics and overall interface are well-designed, but this loading issue seriously affects gameplay. The developers need to fix this problem to improve the user experience.

Moreover we lose those items as well from the City Storage.

Services should work dynamically via roads, covering all connected buildings for more realism. To keep it balanced, the cost of these buildings could be raised.

b71ec850-bf57-4d04-a1df-95bf0128bd84,A Google user,Very fun game. The only downfall is that sometimes upgrade costs too much time and they asked us to watch bunch of ads to skip it. It is really fun simulation game and if you don't care about watching ads to better your city you should try it.,4,2,1.62.1.135396,2025-03-07 09:02:24
13c9ace4-d22b-41cb-88a6-8761977d6efe,A Google user,"100% pay to win. The money on this game comes in painfully slow. Eventually, they want you to upgrade buildings with materials you can't produce. Some of my buildings have been upgraded 10 or more times but it only gets you a little over 1000 simoleons. Meanwhile 1 new building can cost over 20000. 1 upgrade takes so long so quickly it makes this game not worth playing unless your ok with paying a lot for not much returned.",2,11,1.62.1.135396,2025-03-07 08:04:47

f208fa45-d9a3-4134-9393-9c2aa440538b,Nick Gris,"Not a bad game - making progress can be rewarding - but expansions require a lot of parts and getting the parts you need can be frustrating. A marketplace where you can select what you're looking for and it only shows people selling THOSE parts would be a BIG improvement - random sellers just wastes time hunting. Also, trying to select low or small buildings when there's a taller one in front is a pain in the seat-warmer!",4,10,1.62.1.135396,2025-02-28 03:42:55

9104fdaa-cb84-40b3-bda8-6128524c48f4,Lum Cheong,Good to play and bring back some memory. But too much of ads and too much time to spend and wait. Which is typical type of game to make you spend for the game. Come too much of element / side game apart fromt the SIM city itself. Perhaps another trick to get you spend more? But overall the graphic was nice design. Can be better if back to the origin of SIM city some years ago.,3,46,1.61.1.134631,2025-02-20 01:39:13

Even building the most basic houses can require items built from buildings at 5, 10, and 20-minute wait times. Unless you pay real money. Then it's fun. I guess it would cost $30-$50 to have about an hours fun, not having to wait exorbitant amounts of time to progress... If you're happy paying that, then it's a great game.

8cecfbea-a8c7-4f8b-91a8-8fc635412a60,Alan Jaep,Why do I have to confirm EVERYTHING!! Doesn't a normal city run it's self without the mayor having to approve EVERY LITTLE DETAIL? This game is a pain in the neck. Don't bother unless you like having to tap and approve them having to pee and poop!! Way way way too involved!!,1,2,1.61.1.134631,2025-02-14 07:25:38
