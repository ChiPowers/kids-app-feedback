3cf7e826-5bc3-49a4-b473-29cc8769d3dc,Fox Pulse,An absolute masterpiece seems like an indie game for those who love to do business simulation. Economy based games always have things to do so you will never get bored. Sometimes dying can be a bit frustrating because there is no way to get your inventory back.

ca13f1a9-306b-4580-9295-f8fc559937b4,E.T. Deubner,"There is a button at the bottom right that restarts the game with no warning. It seems like a pointless feature. I've accidentally hit it three times now when trying to change gear or mistaking it for the back button during inventory screens. The game plays and looks great. The balance between RPG roguelite dungeon crawling and town building hits all the right notes. I'll probably end up playing on PC instead. Without that reset button, this game gets 5 stars all day long.",4,103,1.13.35,2022-05-30 10:28:31
