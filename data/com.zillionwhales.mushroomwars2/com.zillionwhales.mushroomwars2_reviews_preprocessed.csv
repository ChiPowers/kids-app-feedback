0c91bdfa-a48a-41f3-a3cb-e1676ab1eaa1,A Google user,I love the game and have played it for a few years on and off. To get to the upper levels is a real grind unless you pay. Having now reached level 5 I feel a real satisfaction beating those who clearly paid. Overall a good game. Update to level 10 and I was upgraded to be a level 7 but now seems that upgrades are even costlier than before...... over 400k for an upgrade on level 7 WOW they really want you to pay now,3,7,4.26.1,2022-08-20 14:04:49,surprise,0.9279,418,82.10992248062018,False,False,41,4,Pay-to-Win Frustration,False

It's smooth but alot of the times your actions don't register like if I go to unlock a chest it'll either freeze or its start unlocking but when I check again it'll still be locked. Crashes and all. I played this game years ago and it's still in the same condition the devs are ignorant and trust me they don't plan on fixing this. Almost feels like it's intentional or something.

I wouldn't buy all seasons straight off the cuff cheaper to buy all 3 at the same time but the difficulty goes up so you cant just play them all on easy have to upgrade. Most of the time it seems you can upgrade by winning prizes through battles. But you will probably have to pay to upgrade. Shame you can't just do a one off payment to have full access.
