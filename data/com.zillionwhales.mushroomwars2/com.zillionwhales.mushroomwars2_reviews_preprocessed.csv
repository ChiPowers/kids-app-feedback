Half a star if could I love this game have played it for along time spent alot of money this game but the part that f#$king piss me off is the part is the slowing down of the troops going from one tower to the next. I do pretty good for the well!! But when you lose a few and the game slows your guys down and the other guys are faster then yours that is 1000% an unfair advantage!! This part of the game play slowing troops down is finally going to make me stop playing,1,0,2022.10.03,2022-10-20 18:51:38,499,0.8409,anger,86.35096226415097,False,False,25,0.9934194243178331,22.0,star ratings and reviews,False
