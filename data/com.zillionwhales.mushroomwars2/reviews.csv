They limit the amount of times you can use your abilities, which is the most powerful thing during the match.

The 2nd skill that becomes available during play competely empties the troops in your building. This means it is practically impossible to defend the attack. So what you will find is Chía users taking one building at a time just repeating that tactic. The kicker is they don't lose morale they gain my because they are not having to fight.

1c29606d-7aa4-4d91-9111-a61776f1cc2f,A Google user,I love the game but I'm tired of being destroyed by players who are fully upgraded. Managed to get my account to upgrade 5 kept putting me against rank 7/8 and sometimes 10 so I reset my account thinking il just play the early stage of the game nope. Upgrade 2 now and almost all of my matches are against upgrade 5 it makes the game almost impossible to play if you want a fair game this isn't it. Otherwise alot of fun as I have put in a boat load of hours/days probably a week or two.,3,6,2024.5.0,2024-11-12 05:02:07

Game play is great 5 stars there but now you guys have people pay for everything just to get ahead is the biggest problem with this game. The items that can make you powerful and get a easy win is under a pay wall. I paid for the story mode and a few things I'll admit but it's slowly becoming not worth it. On the upside I'm glad u guys are finally putting in a few new boards thanks for that.,4,26,2024.2.4,2024-03-28 11:10:56

Its absolute trash the last 3 months. 90% of matches are paired with an opponent with 40-100 upgrades higher than you. Forcing you to pay hundreds of dollars to get a few measly victories.

If this was sold as a game for say 30$ with 10$ faction dlcs I would absolutely recommend it even if it is a phone game but the sad fact is either your going to never advance or you will have to pay way way way more money then the ammount above.

Really sad to see how these guys have made the game.,1,1,2023.38.0,2023-10-19 16:05:31

UPDATE: changed rating to 2 stars as I've discovered after spending $30+ on in-app purchases it's no fun to play without unlimited charges to heroes. If you want to enjoy the freedom to play all your heroes you must spend a minimum of $6.99 every 30 days for the Premium pass. Who needs more recurring fees or subscriptions?

Of course you will be told about it only after intro is finished. The whole interface is trashed with donate stuff, and the game has even donate pop ups, which is pretty annoying. If you don't want to pay, pay a lot, and pay regularly, don't even start. Even if you buy the solo campaign, you will be regularly annoyed with begging for donate and ADS screaming in your face.

I understand the developers has to get paid and it's expensive but you should consider cheaper prices for a mobile game, asking for a 100 pounds for a new caracter is a lot of money. For not even max stats just the base. 5 pounds for the character and 100 for max stats i would consider it but for a base....",1,1,2022.11.25,2022-12-22 01:24:43

4087df86-978e-428b-b159-0d8cc280d214,A Google user,Been playing and paying for the game for awhile now and found out its a total garbage. The matchmaking is a joke. It looks like the top updated players loose on purpose so they can noob bash players that has not manage to get far in the upgrades and you have 0% chase to win. Especially events like example Arena : Boggi. I actually paid for it to try finish it played 3 hours a day everyday and has finished 30% of it. It's just impossible for new generation players.

Using fake reviews look at most of the reviews. 1 stars They delete comments. 1 star is way to high too much lag every time some attacks and the pay to win is terrible 0.0 talent for the paytowin. It crashes more frequently than before the update. New update game crashes when on 5 g and not wifi. This game is more pay to win even in the campaign which costs money (no complaints on this if you make a stand alone game you can charge for it) but pay to win is such low rent trash.,1,5,2022.11.25,2022-12-16 05:47:19

Unlocking chests is a huge pain since you can use gems or watch vids. After every upgrade you make to your profile or character you get a popup store offer trying to get you to buy something. That is very lame. I used to give this game 5 stars but im giving it 4 because of how often and the length of ads.

Majority of the game is behind truly ridiculous pay walls. 3 types of very expensive in game currency? The epitome of a pay to win game.

I played this game years ago and it's still in the same condition the devs are ignorant and trust me they don't plan on fixing this. Almost feels like it's intentional or something.

Also too much payment and regular payments asked for. Want more money than a proper designed game for computer or console. Can you stop forcing players into multi-opponent battles? Especially against vastly more developed opponents. Have separate choice for more than one opponent or one on one. So had to win matches in that format.,1,3,4.24.3,2022-06-30 03:08:06

The reason I'm giving it two stars is because it is the most aggressively microtransaction riddled game I have ever played. They do their best to work on FOMO (fear of missing out). I mean seriously? $99 for one single item. They never give you offers for items for characters that you have already unlocked either. Only for the characters you have not unlocked yet.

Pointless changes to the way you can see abilities, the icons for your skills do not match those that you can use in battle. classes are still unbalanced. They have made it so that you get less rewards now, and make you watch an ad to get more cards. I was happy to watch ads to gain ability points back, but now I have to watch ads to pretty much get anything in the game.

They have boosted stats and equipment and they are toxic. Devs only want money. I've been playing for years never managed past char level 35 and spent a fair bit. Play against ranks 44 tier 6 and always gold artefact peopl3. Game is good but unfair as such cya..... money grabbing bstards..

Still a Massive pay to win game unless you blow a lot of money. If you dont drop a ton of money into the game dont expect a win ratio above 30%. The game pairs you with people 2-3 times your ranking and you stand no chance. Can confirm they give premium users additional advantages in game like faster troop reproduction and faster bar fillup,1,0,4.24.3,2022-06-22 14:37:32

On top of this there are many problems. Controls sometimes don't work, and it can take just one missed command to lose a game. Matchmaking is awful. One in ten games of 2v2 are evenly matched. 1v1 used to match well, but that's become bad as well. Opponents/teammates are usually either way above or way below your rank.

f5a1823d-9efa-407d-9d5d-be4dbf91dff2,A Google user,This game is pay to win. You get characters with special abilities to help you win but they have limited uses. Yes you can recharge those uses with time or watching ads. But you can't recharge them when you are in the middle of a match. Meanwhile the players who payed for it get unlimited energy. Meaning longer matches are very much in favor of the ones who pay money. If you want a fair game that doesn't ask for your money every time you turn it on this is not the game for you.,2,5,4.22.0,2022-03-28 06:40:22

It's easy to tell they lose less troops when they attack. There troops move faster. So you stand very little chance of winning a against them.

The only way to advance is to pay $30..$50 or $100 for advantages...or complete daily challenges but then those daily challenges you're pitted against people 3 to 6 times stronger than you or a computer player who has those paid for skills to motivate you to pay for them. Curious if 5 stars puts this near the top and not hidden lol,5,6,4.22.0,2022-03-23 04:28:34

The fact that you can only use it in a certain amount of time and number makes it seems like its just an emergency skill. You really should make it so it can be use every match, I think it will be a lot more of fun and competitive cause as of now its such a downer for me as a new player, when im playing i always have doubts of whether i should use my skills or not and when i do, I get bored on the next run. hope you can consider my suggestion.",3,13,4.21.0,2022-03-06 04:00:28

Occasional lag can ruin the game and the only fix is to uninstall and reinstall the game. The morale system needs some work. One bad attack and its game over basically. It favours very defensive play and is the reason some games are spent doing nothing as neither player wants to attack. 2v2 match making is a joke, don't waste time until very upgraded.",4,12,4.19.0,2022-01-26 11:09:02

Just greedy people. Don't install this game until you have a nut loose in your brain. Just uninstalled when it asked money for continuing campaign. I would have really shot if the developer was there infront of me at that moment.,1,0,,2022-01-20 14:44:14

I fully think well made games should be paid for. Even think subscription games such as WoW were not badly over priced.

You have to spend massive money to keep up, it isn't just pay to win, it's the more you pay you can't lose. That's why nearly all the reviews say the same thing. The worst part is the developers don't care. They don't even read the reviews. That's why if you look at the comments the developers give it is always the same.

976feaa9-160e-44a5-ba7f-365c0c9fe3a7,A Google user,I like the game. I wouldn't buy all seasons straight off the cuff (cheaper to buy all 3 at the same time) but the difficulty goes up so you cant just play them all on easy have to upgrade. Most of the time it seems you can upgrade by winning prizes through battles. But you will probably have to pay to upgrade. Shame you can't just do a one off payment to have full access. Instead its monthly. Clever. But rubbish for the gamer! Still like the game though.,4,28,4.13.0,2021-10-07 06:10:36

But, unfortunately, those who want to play without paying or pay little, I do not recommend it because the game is made so that if you have a monthly pass, you have facilities and you fight with a similar ranking, but after the fee expires, the fight is nonsense because you fight with rankings that are even 2 times higher than your ranking.

If you're doing well against people with the same gear/experience as you then the game will definitely ""humble"" you by matching you up against their premium players. Opponents with much better gear, and battle bonuses (ie troop attack %, troop production speed, etc.) really don't leave you with much of a chance to win. This completely burned me out on the game.

For instance one of the heros that I'd unbalanced is Chia. Another problem, the heros that give yo6 different abilitys and make the game fun in each battle. Their abilities can be upgraded, but these upgrade abilities make the game almost unplayable if you don't have them.",5,1,4.11.1,2021-09-01 15:28:03

This game would be so much better if you didn't run into people who obviously spend a bunch of money to have unlimited power ups and special items.

Free version is limited but you still can have a little fun. I bought the game but can't share it with my son through google family and it's a bit expensive to pay it for each family member. But the major downside is that this version relly focus on making money. Even after you bought it, you don't have access to everything and still prompt for buying stuff all the time.

What makes the game unique is the heroes system, it makes the boring numbers game interesting by adding skills to play tricks to your opponent. Making the skills require energy to be used is just a big no for me. They give you a few days of premium to have unlimited skills to see how fun it can become but after that its back to the boring nunbers game.

If only they'd get rid of the pay-to-win, dark design, and aiming to be addictive instead of fun, this could be fantastic. As it is, three stars, which is pretty great for a mobile game. Update after playing it some more... The unequal footing in every match due to out-of-match progression really ruins it. Winning is meaningless when I'm overpowered. Two stars.
