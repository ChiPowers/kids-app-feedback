But, recently a glitch has appeared that is sucking the fun out of this great game. At the end of the game when you watch ads to get more moves, the ad for apple 16 phone just ends the level. Even if you let it sit for 5 minutes, or more. It tells you to watch the whole ad to get reward. Major glitch, please fix. I would love to give 5 stars.

There seems to be more 100% block puzzles than Pet Rescue games, & some games force one to use boosters in order to complete, no longer making it fun to play. There is no customer support screen to let them know parts of the game don't work, or to let them know what a mess they've made of a once enjoyable game.",1,17,3.8.1,2024-09-04 14:28:39

I have counted my moves. I will start with a high number after about five clicks the numbers has come down to half the beginning. So I can not continue to play with the board game. Example being to 54 chances, after 5 moves. Instead of the moves being 49, it is suddenly dropped to 24 moves. This is not fair to players.",5,59,1.487.5,2024-01-30 08:48:20

So many missed rewards with this ploy; a crafty way to try and force players to buy boosts for the game. Now the game offers extra moves if an ad is watched...surprise! Tap on the watch ad choice and the game completely shuts down makibg you start the same level again! No way to address this problem and it has been going on for weeks.

The events and offers between stages makes the user experience bad. Keep it simple don't try to add extra games side by side. I don't want to clean ur pet or silly petopia event. The game makers should rethink why pet rescue ia not so hit as candy crush.,3,2,1.119.11,2023-07-09 02:43:59

I like how older UI version where each level is on a pathway of a different world from our real world. Gives us players a feeling that were exploring pet's world with realistic graphic landscape of what would look like for animals without humans. But we get this new UI with cheap and laziness 3d graphic design of this game. The game has lost a lot of feelings and excitements about this game.,2,72,1.444.4,2023-06-15 18:36:28

With all due respect, this game is terrible. I used to play it a lot a few years back with the old (and better) pet models. There was absolutely NO reason to change the whole set up of the game too, and now it looks just boring. Please just change the game to what it used to be, because I was extremely disappointed when I found this game again. Do better.",1,1,,2023-06-02 09:34:43

We're supposed to get the proper color next to it to break. It open for the pet. You give us yellow pet carriers and no yellow blocks to bust it open. So I'm just gonna get rid of it.,1,13,1.437.7,2023-05-02 20:51:31

Idk it's just too much going on and it's not fun anymore. Idk what to suggest to make it fun... well they did take away some cool features like using gold bars to replay a level but u only get 5 moves. Before it was like 10-20 moves.

I love the game play it everyday im on level 2542 but I got a new phone and lost all my weapons that I brought and earned over time. I don't like the carnival bec I shouldn't have to use my gold bars to play. I play bec I do alot of thinking to it. also who idea was it to make waiting for a new life take longer than 10 min each. its dumb,2,157,1.366.26,2022-07-27 20:04:52

Last month I'd of gave it 4 stars, not now. Deleted the game as I can't bear watching 3 to 6 adverts at a time at 30 secs per advert and they've got a cheek to ask u to buy power ups if u don't watch the ads to get them. I don't mind a few ads but this game is a joke. They're better games out there with load less adverts.",1,1,,2022-07-27 08:05:19

Colorful graphics, challenging & fun, special events to earn boosters & stuff to help with the really hard levels. I do sometimes spend few bucks to 'power up', really don't have to tho because this game has great daily gifts & what-not without spending a dime. I play daily, miss it when I don't..

I have played this game so long until I'm past 5000 levels. But it frustrates me now bcuz the levels are impossible to win and every time i come close to winning and need an extra move i watch the video only for the game to freeze afterwards and have to be restarted. Then i have to play the level another 100 times. I'm sick of this game at this point!,1,5,1.351.38,2022-05-20 21:27:19

As far as I can figure out so far there's no way to get my money back so it gets a 3 instead of a 5 and I say beware because they do like to rip you off,3,162,1.332.14,2022-02-01 15:17:36

There's no way I'm going to save 14 pets when I've only been able to save at the most is 3. I don't like how it doesn't explain the use of tools. Or how it doesn't give you clues, for example, must blow up black boxes to bring pets down. It just doesn't do it for me. I'm not an in app purchaser, I won't ever be.
