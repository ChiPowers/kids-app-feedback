I'd like to say maybe 15 times minimum, now I've had issues with campaign while having the game tell me my team is ""strong"" compared to the enemy.",3,0,1.0.905,2025-07-25 15:48:44

They got rid of dailys for gems. after you hit the content clear wall you have to run arena which gets old really fast. the whales buy the new rare pvp units that have a 200 pity pull. I have done 300 of these pulls over a 5 year time. the gear grind will have you do a stage 100 times and still jot get the roll you want. if you play the game, just dont get to invested.",1,10,1.0.900,2025-06-12 10:25:27

I have been playing for quite a few years, but it's becoming harder and harder to care for a game operated on predatory practices from the publisher and devs. It is VERY clear that the balance team really has no idea what the hell they are doing.

Why have him ignore ER for being tanky, ignore movement impairment, and give him a 2 turn stun along with removing counterattacks and an HP scaling barrier. That's not even including the random bs defense break you can't even ignore because he ignores ER. If you had him remove counterattacks that's enough.

QoL has increased greatly, E7's real problem is the lack of thoughtful balancing. The game still revolves around a few core units that easily outshine 100+ other units that exist.

The graphics are there, as well as the gameplay, artwork and characters. The base is perfect, but some how it went crooked. The game screen is a mess, especially for a f2p, 92% are for p2w, maybe even more. I can see where the complain are coming from.

It reduces lag and lowered the graphics if I remember.

SG keeps dropping the ball, with no worthy QoL, more greedy bs. e7 has went from one of the GOATS, to being a dry turd. SG needs to learn how SW, RSL, and other long lasting games have thrived, instead of being greedy, and screwing the Global/NA fanbase. Shame on you, SG!!",1,3,1.0.578,2025-04-03 07:28:51

Good quality above average gear that only the endgame players might scoff at. The meta is in shambles. They release a new Moonlight every month and it's a 50/50 whether or not it breaks the meta. They have stats in the game that they continuously let units outright ignore. New players go elsewhere. They did not change course from a shipwreck.,1,5,1.0.829,2025-02-28 02:35:49

The game is incredibly f2p friendly for PvE. PvP is about drafting and knowledge. Trying to be number 1 in pvp will of course be difficult without spending money. Heroes obtained comes very easily and plenty of rewards and events. Gacha is very fair. Major downside of this game is the lack of balance for pvp. They don't nerf heroes, only powercreep them.",4,12,1.0.791,2024-11-02 16:32:46

This locks you out of rewards from the beginner quest line. You have to attain several ranks within the PVP to finish the quest. The UI is poorly explained and sometimes the instructions are in a 2 pt font. A good game in general but not for anyone new.,1,11,1.0.791,2024-10-26 11:16:01

The story is great, the fighting is great, the characters and their designs are great, it's just the amount of storage it requires makes it almost impossible to download and play it for a lot of people, myself.

Gear is still a pain to grind for and the 10 auto clears is a joke. Mystic medal are extremely scarce even with all the new Ml units added. Summon rates have yet to have any improvment.

But the crafting portion is frustrating you spend so much material for crafting and you still get almost nothing. In this game gear crafting has lot of importance cause characters are easy to get. Your gear which you put on the characters makes the difference from your opponents. So much to do in the game so you have to invest time to it.,4,6,,2024-05-20 05:50:40

Moonlight heros still hard to gain resouces hard to come by to grow heros. No reset hero option sweep on towers etc set to 10 trys that doesn't help with grinding at all. The game has lost its magic fully. Even OuterPlane is awful which I'm guessing was meant to take over in making cash from this game.

Eating this broke the game. Customer support said it was impossible to fix. Years later I made a new account . I encountered another bug from an event that made it so I didn't get prizes I earned.

More so recently the game has gone down hill. With over 200 units only 15-20 are playable maybe less. The power creep in this game has done it zero justice. PvP is god awful. Pve while good at first quickly realize there isn't much. There balancing isn't good either as they don't exactly buff character who need it just newer units. Even when they do there not good.,2,1,1.0.757,2024-04-06 11:27:27

Battles used to be strategy, but now it's the same units for every single battle. It's so dull now, compared to before when nearly everyone was viable if built right. It's a shame since the art is really good, but the current meta is so stale these days. Nerfs are important to keep powerful units in check, but the no-nerf policy just hurts the game by stifling creativity and diversity.

5c3e0f68-3eba-4b01-99c2-4926fa0b0ef2,A Google user,Animation is great but the pull rates for heroes especially gear is ridiculous. For example over 5500 Mystics gone and get absolutely nothing. You hardly get any gear and 98% of the time waste all resources to pity new heroes. It's set up for to have to pay for resources. And I almost thought this game was different than others. Hating this game even more. It's difficult to get resources as it is in this game. And yet again pulled the same 3☆ artifact and got nothing!,3,9,1.0.736,2024-03-02 17:28:47

If u don't get the latest new broken ML or RGB unit u might as well not even participate in arena or RTA. The RNG in battles makes the game unplayable and not fun at all. The gear system is one of the most terrible in gotcha games. It takes way to long to farm to get gear and u are not rewarded for ur efforts as most of the gear is unusable.

The character art is beautiful and the animations are clean. There is plenty of content and for the most part, a free to pay player can get great units relatively easy. The game also has many events to keep players glued to it. I will say PvP is the worst part of the game due to how hard it is to get good rolls on the game.

f6947c68-1d90-489a-af4f-ad1c78d31c28,A Google user,This is actually a really solid game. Looks really great visually and have a nice PvE content. But the equipment farming process takes too much time. This game will kill your phone battery because you will leave your phone running the game all day long to repeat the exact same stage hundreds of time. The worst thing is there is no guarantee all of the materials that you've farmed all day will turn into useable equipment because the stat will be randomized. So pls do something about this..,1,5,1.0.675,2024-01-17 18:45:14

The gameplay is smooth, character designs are great, and there is a huge amount of content to clear. However, I've had to stop playing due to the RNG mechanics, which became a massive problem at the late game. RTA is decided by RNG % (speed, 15% ect), and it's even worse in end game PvE where levels can take upwards of 30 mins only to lose to a random number. Peace E7, it's been real.",1,32,1.0.710,2024-01-08 06:49:33

There are just some things I don't like so much anymore. There's too many limited units coming out that are very bad at first and then get buffed so people pull last minute and possibly spend money. Then the balancing team needs to explain how ML Landy has gone this long without a nerf. I don't want a team that relies on RNG, I want skills that always take effect.

I hope there's events in the future to be able to get more characters and for them to add more ultimate animations to the rest of the characters. It does get a bit boring after a few fight for me since i like to immersive myself while playing.

There's a bit of extra compare to typical one i.e voice over, long stories etc. The reason I reduce a star is the lack of character 100+ vs such as summoners war 2500+, Example only 2 Vilvred in this game, repeat attack all if enemies die or himself dies. There can be more variations - when any allies die, or he has 2 or more debuf.

This was easily a 5* game back then, but as of October 2023, I will finally be quitting the game for the aggravating lack of balance. I used to have joy in finding teams that enable counter play into ""meta"" heroes, but sadly that feeling is lost from this game. The current game state is a mess of unbalanced and unfair units pushed out one after another. Any counters are pitifully weak to units like Lua, ML Landy, and Nokwol.
