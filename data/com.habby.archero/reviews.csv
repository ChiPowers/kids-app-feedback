3341fae3-d71d-47be-af85-0b13f0baa2ba,A Google user,This game is great. The reward system and level up system is amazing. but there's some bugs in this game. I went to play in the monster arena and it made me use 2 uses instead of 1. other than a few bugs the game is amazing and has plenty of content. There are only ads if you want extra rewards which is perfectly fine. great game.,4,72,6.11.2,2025-04-20 13:57:52

Or pay to process faster and compete with other players who paid to play. I enjoyed it as a free to play and casually spend my time playing it once or twice a day for like 15-30 minutes. Most importantly it's the skill rolls. You just need luck sometimes. Also that jungle challenge is so lag, as soon as I reached 8 minutes and beyond. It takes 10 minutes to get to the next boss.",3,0,4.3.7,2025-04-02 10:23:00

Also I can not send a screenshot but the screen goes black and stays like that until I get rid of the tab.

The health can be at less than 10 percent. There is no way possible to have two monsters alive at a near death state. It drives me crazy. If they can upgrade that, I'll be complaint free.

Often times when you go to visit other players farms it says you can't connect and try again later. You can never connect until the day counter resets making it impossible to finish your quests.

Somebody had questioned how when you stop the spin the wheel it jumps from the item you stopped it on to something one or two positions to the left or right for something else. They also described how the ads fail to work. Which was mentioned but not the wheel by complete neglect of their failure to acknowledge and accept the poor development of the game.,1,5,6.3.0,2024-09-26 11:37:27

0c413c3d-438f-443d-86e4-9bd62e970a0d,A Google user,I installed the new update 3 hours ago and I haven't been able to play it. Nothing works and the 30 day event is no longer there. Fix this ASAP for a better review or I will delete the app I have been playing for 4 years and never had this problem. Now the game is too glitchy. The hero wont move sometimes or it will get stuck going forward. Basically the controls don't respond sometimes. This game is becoming unplayable.,2,10,6.2.0,2024-09-07 12:10:55

So here is my suggestion: make the game offline so if there is no Internet you still can have the stuff got not only the default weapon.,5,0,4.7.1,2024-09-07 10:42:58

I did that and they transferred the data. About a month ago I saw that they added Habby ID. After signing up for it you get an email saying everything is saved to the cloud. I thought oh cool I can log in on Android. Every time I try to log in it says the email is used with a different account.

The game is fun but real progress is only attainable with purchases otherwise it's very slow. The last few months of updates has increased difficulty so much that my character is now weaker than 3 months ago even though I have been constantly upgrading it. I have also noticed that every time it updates I lose valuable resources. I lost a lot of yellow and red tickets. Not good.,2,25,6.1.1,2024-08-11 15:12:54

The main reason I am giving 1 star is because of the lack of accessibility features. I am currently on chapter 19, but the problem is I am color blind. The chapter has a dark green floor and all the monsters shoot dark red projectiles. That'd be fine if it was 1 or 2, but I literally cannot see at least 50% of the shots which means I just have to tank every hit. Please add colorblind settings.",1,87,5.14.1,2024-06-14 12:32:47

When you choose the ad it's a 50/50 if you continue or they end it right then. So you watch the ad for nothing other then to make the creator $.

You can lose a level because the game will randomly lag and now you've lost health because of it. The more enemies you have the more laggy it is and it's frustrating. And again it's not the enemies that are the sole problem because if the game ran right and you lost then that's on you but you do often lose to lag that it's almost never your fault,2,13,5.11.3,2024-04-16 12:37:16

b00dc356-78d5-40e6-b30a-6725f497755e,A Google user,A solid 3 for this game. A really good game at early levels but gets ridiculous at later levels. Because lot of the times your chance of winning depends on random skills set from which u can choose. And you have to play several levels at a time without dying to win otherwise u start all over again. Either buff the skills nerf the enemies. Cause there is projectiles everywhere.

Beating levels that you already beat has no rewards at all. All upgrades on a level are randomized, feels too RNGey cause some upgrades suck and others are really strong.

If you don't want to spend most of the game grinding just to get past a single level, you're in luck because this game practically encourages you to spend money. Several events are impossible to 100% if you don't spend more money than the game is worth. Worth noting, the daily events also do not scale to your level and it's pretty obviously designed for players who spend money since unless you're a high level you won't get far.",3,0,5.10.2,2024-03-27 11:58:02

If you don't however, be ready to play for hundreds of days to get a chance at progressing. At a certain point it's not about skill, it's Luck. Worst part is the graphics make it near impossible to discern what's happening when there are more than 6 or 7 sprites on the screen. ADHD kids will love!",3,0,5.10.1,2024-03-07 17:58:56

If they added a crafting section where you had to use coins instead of gems, it would be easier to progress. It would also allow for more players due to easier progression and more fun game play because you would be trying to get the coins to craft the items that you want to fuse together. But as to not let the crafting be overpowered they should make it so you can only craft common gear and you can only craft 10 items everyday.",4,0,,2024-03-06 12:14:00

I came back to this game hoping that, after several years, the developers would fix the impossible bosses (rng whether you get those or numbingly easy ones) and projectile spam. What I came back to was not only not at ALL improved, but also disgusting monetization: multiple battle passes, many characters locked behind $30 paywalls, and constant popups!",1,20,5.9.2,2024-02-25 22:34:56

I like that it starts at round 1 and goes so on and so for up to round 50, and you lose if you die (you have to start over). But you can upgrade every couple rounds and get stronger as you go. However once you die you have to restart from round 1 and rebuild back up all over again. But you earn points to put towards you base build that you take into the game with you every time no matter what but in order to get your base built up you have to play..",5,111,5.9.2,2024-02-14 01:03:41

So far the only difference that impact the player is the amount of transactions added which for someone not able to spend regularly might seem much nevertheless there's still easy to progress quests and free rewards that balance that and also purchases are always optional! New UI changes also seem to be nice so far! Overall game deserves high rating. Keep up!,5,1,,2023-12-26 01:16:49

Buggy is bad enough, but when it's stealing opertunities, resources, and not counting actions towards goals for rewards, it's downright frustrating. Also, the ads are getting out of control. Ads that you have to take multiple actions to close out of, ads that will open the play store no matter what you do, & not getting rewards for ads watched when that's the offer. I'm done.

When you clear a stage, they give you more skills, but the issue is that these new skils create new builds, but you remain locked to only choosing 3 skills per level. It is the equivalent of a restaurant having the best food but is sold out of a minivan. Fun, challenging gameplay that doesn't reward you for clearing the stages besides relief that it's over.

The ads are optional which is great but when you do watch them for rewards the game crashes most the time. The worst part is when you reload the game you have to watch the ad again because it didn't count the first time because of the crash. Duo is cool but it crashes a lot and it's really laggy. Overall game is great but please fix the ads from crashing the game. Thanks,4,142,5.3.1,2023-10-07 13:26:29

The progression is good for free-to-play players but unfortunately this game is plagued with cheaters. Soooooo many cheaters. I've given up h√åope of unlocking either exclusive Sylvan skins and will never be able to get to the top of any leaderboard. You can only go so far until you either need to pour money into the game and be a whale or become a scumbag cheater.. otherwise deal with it I guess.. :/,2,0,5.2.2,2023-09-24 19:21:29
