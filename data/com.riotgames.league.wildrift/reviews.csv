I actually think it's funny to lose to the pro players because you learn from them. And it's OK to carry noob teammates coz it's also teach you patience and forgiving because everyone's skills is not the same you should understand that. would be nice to have more controls customization for tablet users,5,6,6.2.0.8711,2025-07-17 07:14:41

Its smooth, the controls feel great, I love the ranked climb system, I love the skins, I love the changes that seperate it from the PC version. The only thing I can complain about in the monetisation. It is far far less generous than the PC version of League and that is saying something. It really makes me feel bad spending on it.

The matchmaking is not good because my teamates used the news Champs for practicing in rank when I play also some of them they don't take the game seriously and some also they eventually throw the match when they feed too much and some used champ that are not meant for there role as it eventually lead for solo players having a hard time ranking.,4,0,6.1.0.8573,2025-06-20 00:31:13

Can only hope movements become more fluid eventually. Edit: Reinstalled it recently to see they have so many game modes that I wish were on the original. It is a little unfortunate seeing all the fun attention Wild Rift is receiving over LOL. Movement input lag is still an issue as well as a slight delay in ability casts/auto attacks.

We always get low-level teammates who play like bots, while the enemy team is full of high-level players (level 100+). It feels unfair and ruins the fun. If our teammates are low-level, the enemies should be balanced too — or at least bots. This keeps happening especially in normal matches. We love the game, but this makes it hard to enjoy.

6ed80eda-bc14-47c5-bc2e-804f3fc798b9,A Google user,been playing since the beta and what led me to this rating 1 star is the awful experience of playing pvp with AI team mates. I mean literally they dont respond to chats and pings and would just respawn die respawn die. Worst they purposely get caught during objectives that lead to defeat. I know few people play wildrift but adding AI just to compensate isnt helping. Hope the developers fix this. For now 1 star.,1,6,6.1.0.8573,2025-04-17 23:50:49

Unfortunately, there are really few moba games on mobile, and even fewer quality MOBAs. Riot, a company with a lot of money, hasn't done anything good either. I don't have the worst phone, but the game doesn't maintain a stable 60 fps even on the lowest graphics settings.(Pixel7a) It's impossible to play in the rankings, the players are selected somehow, which is why you have 10 losses in a row.

Developers don't care about the issues the community is facing and don't listen to the community: matchmaking still not fixed and they made it even worse with bots, the same champions are on meta all the time, skill level of players are low for the rank they are sitting, buffing and reworking champs no one asked for, no communication options for teamwork (only chat) and gacha gacha gacha",1,1,6.0.0.8429,2025-02-28 13:01:04

Match making is absolutely broken + low player are boosted and even if you are really good, you end playing with noob ! If your start is not good enough, players are leaving with a very low sanction like 2 min waiting on lane lmao ! They are more focus on how implemant news things to buy than just make this game playable. On top of that there is more and more player usine cheatcode.... just go on another game guys !",1,0,6.0.0.8429,2025-02-28 11:12:47

The environment is as much toxic as Chernobyl and the games try the best from it to make it unbalanced! I have played this game for a lot of time now, the matchmaking is always unbalanced, not matched by skills, not matched by levels, not matched by winning rate. How it is always possible that 3 out of 5 of my games my teammates are 16-38 teirs below me(2-10 ranks below) and 1/3 games one of them leaves the game. Does 6 points protect my rank?",1,1,6.0.0.8429,2025-02-28 10:36:46

There are alot of useless gifts that I don't care if it exists or not, also I play Katarina and Zed sometimes I need more range to control, (for example throwing shruken from long distance to opposite direction, and shunpoing on a distant daggers outher edge, it is not possible to do that or I am missing something",5,0,6.0.0.8429,2025-02-28 09:57:13

Too many pop ups from different events everytime, unstable ping even though when I play on pc I have steady 50-70ms. Also, today I have been getting a message of unstable network even though it seems work like normal, and I cannot enter the game. I think it would be good to optimise performance and quality of life aspect instead of just introducing new events. (Samsung A52).",2,95,6.0.0.8429,2025-02-28 06:58:03
