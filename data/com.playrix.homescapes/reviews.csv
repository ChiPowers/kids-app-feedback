b81e8e7e-bb3d-4695-a1b3-ae9bac338b51,A Google user,After years of playing I'm uninstalling. The June update RUINED this game. Only 10-30 coins for a win. Pretty certain the game engines cheat & force you to lose a puzzle so you either spend 900 coins or RL money to win one puzzle. No longer able to change decorations. And let's not forget the childish graphics now. Horrible UI. Don't bother playing if you're thinking about it.,1,7,8.1.1,2025-07-20 09:28:40

Challenges are almost impossible to complete now as it asks for too much. Been playing this game for long time and spent enoug money. Also season pass has gotten too expensive.

The game eventually forces you to only play via the internet after a while, according to support. It's very misleading, as the advertisements say you don't need it. There are no humans to support you if you can figure out how to explain your issue. Boosters randomly stop early as well",1,3,8.1.1,2025-07-17 11:44:23

It's is also rigged with boosters hitting random tiles instead of targets. The latest update is abysmal in terms of graphics and boosters. Disgrace to what used to be a fun game.

0f1a75bc-7193-4e46-925b-57cbd177c2a5,A Google user,"More bad news: After 14000 levels or so the hard and super hard rounds have become so repetitive. It's always starting with a corner of the screen, requiring the user to clear a load of difficult barrier such as a brick wall, iron ramp or coloured bricks. It's slower and doesn't allow stacking of power. Looks like it's time to delete the game. The mini games have been missing for thousands of rounds also reduces the pleasure of the game. The renovations are lame and the furniture are ugly.",1,7,8.0.3,2025-07-12 04:34:01

I've found some levels impossible to beat until the game recognized I was losing a level too many times and gave me some extra in-level boosters to help. There are no ads. There are optional in-game purchases, but I've never opted for them. If you run out of lives, you have to take a 15-30 minute break before a new life is added.

Without having the bonus boosts and such. Done to try and make you spend. At level 7937 there's 16 moves but apparently if I buy something I get +35 moves more than double what you start with. If you want to be f2p and can ignore the nonsense they add its still enjoyable just expect to hit walls sometimes.,3,4,8.0.5,2025-07-03 15:37:34

The game lags and crashes a lot especially when I'm in the middle of a level. On top of that, levels are getting harder and harder to beat and moves are too little for each level.

I've passed level 14 thousand and suddenly after the update levels have gone way too hard. even levels that they categorise as easy take a long time to complete. on a lot of levels instead of having to collect 2 things I now have to collect 3 or 4 things without enough moves. I regularly have to spend coins and boosters to progress. the fact that it costs 900 coins for 5 moves is ridiculous. 500 for 5 moves is fair.,3,25,8.0.5,2025-06-25 07:17:30

For example - The rocket-bomb combo now looks like a rocket dragging a bomb behind it — looks cheap, awkward and unpolished. This really affects the overall gameplay experience. The old version was way better in design and feel and I think that needs to be brought back.",4,16,8.0.5,2025-06-19 12:41:55

But no, they got greedy, so now most people delete the game once they realize the levels past 200 are unwinnable. You mods responding to these comments, NOBODY believes you when you say ""the games are winnable with the right strategy"". I've seen many video walk-throughs. You changed the levels. You can't win without paying, unless they let you. Deleted",1,0,7.9.7,2025-06-13 06:19:06

You used to get 50 coins when you beat a regular level and now you only get 10.

0c0bd7c9-30bd-4bbd-aa18-84084a048d87,A Google user,This new update is really disappointing. They have just made beating a normal level harder by increasing the obstacles one has to complete while still maintaining the same amount of moves. It feels like the only reason for these unfair changes is to force players to make in-app purchases because you simply can't earn enough just by playing anymore. Progress thus feels almost impossible. This game now feels like a boring chore rather than the fun experience it used to be.,1,5,,2025-06-06 14:55:29

There is a gold ball bomb, takes 10 lvls to get. I had it. But all of a sudden, yesterday I signed in and it just vanished. I hadn't played the day B4. So how did I lose my gold ball.

88fe7251-de18-4ff5-a85a-b9348488e2ac,A Google user,Re-reviewing after 5years. This game is now getting irritative. The normal game win coins have reduced to 10 coins instead of 50 coins. i used to do in-app purchases but slowly i realised my friend is getting better offer who doesnt do in-app purchase. for ₹89 i get 1500 coins but others get 3000 coins. so injustice. Then there is trophy game which pauses the actual game but then then is no star when you win the game. Once stuck in trophy difficulty level it takes days to complete. irritative,1,6,4.1.3,2025-06-05 01:48:13

There is never enough moves to clear everything. Its more of a money grab than before!! When you cant beat a normal level with the rainbow ball and power ups you know they have mafe it harder. I have been stuck on a normal level all day now and that never happens. If the update doesnt get reversed, ill delete the game!!",1,22,8.0.2,2025-05-30 16:19:26

612711d9-b0e2-4e34-b13b-ee8a8a30f701,A Google user,I love this game and have been playing for a long time. It's one of the few games left that isn't full of a bunch of ads and annoying ad breaks. It has fun mini games and a good story line to keep you entertained. You are not forced to spend money on coins to play although you can if you want to. Also lots of opportunities for unlimited lives for a time period which is nice. If you are tired of games with ads and looking to be entertained. This game is for you.,5,0,,2025-05-27 10:54:20

I had to restart the game because it seemed like Austin didn't even want to stop drinking his tea. I lost the power ball, and progress on the super hard level, in the middle of team tournament. And when the game has restarted, the number of coins i have didn't even change. I wasted my money, and lost all the hard work I've been putting on the game. It sucks",1,9,7.9.7,2025-05-25 11:02:17

I got the recommend on mistplay so I tried it out and everything was great until the event.which is still a good event I just feel like maybe there should be some kinda warning or up your age range when ur r going 2 go true 2 the whole familile relationships of persephone. I'm mainly saying this because I was having my nieces play this game w/ me because the games rating on the page said it was in their age range too. but I just don't think its a safe topic for them,4,2,7.9.7,2025-05-17 21:59:38

bb794f88-a4bf-4853-8a92-abd57cc75130,A Google user,I truly used to love this game. I'm on level 8009 and I'm probably going to uninstall. The levels are entirely too difficult to win. It sucks the fun out of the game entirely. Then when you lose it gives you a pop-up to buy a booster you accidentally press it and end up losing 900 coins. Or you'll finally get a super booster just to lose it immediately. I'm tired of spending 3-4 days stuck on one level. Game is a huge cash grab now and Never spent a penny on it.,2,10,7.9.7,2025-05-16 19:36:24

I'm tired of the power ups...something that actual money buys...exploding just because my finger accidentally brushes against my screen during gameplay. Waste of money because of how things are stacked even when you buy extras. Some is to be expected but I hate feeling like I'm throwing away money.,1,75,7.9.7,2025-05-15 16:46:57

a8ba1b76-bd33-489e-b6fc-493d50fdf397,A Google user,The game used to be much better before. Now there's just a bunch of trails every other day which is kinda annoying. There's too many hard/super hard levels that can't be completed even with boosters. Being stuck on one level for days is so frustrating! The moves on normal levels are also quite low. And in the lake house I can't seem to decorate my own space- like it chose most of the decor for me in one of the rooms which doesn't make any sense.,3,2,,2025-05-05 10:45:37

However, as with most games of this type, you get to a point where it is deliberately so difficult and frustrating that you either spend money to win or spend days, maybe a week plus, on a single level. You can burn through an hour or more worth of infinite lives and not beat a level even with boosters. No thanks and goodbye!",1,12,7.9.5,2025-05-04 11:29:45

I can't make money I'll end up uninstalling the game this way. Please help!",1,9,7.8.6,2025-04-30 09:16:40

820258a3-91e3-48c9-986b-5ba717b369ae,A Google user,I'm tired of updating this game every 3 days. Really reconsidering uninstalling it for a better game. Used to love playing it but its just getting to be a hassle. Plus costs too much to play anymore. Also you have to pay to get the golden ticket. That should be free as an incentive if you beat more than a 1000+ levels. Also it takes away stars you have earned on every level whether it be 1 or 3 stars. I think it is glitching.,1,28,7.8.6,2025-04-15 04:53:35

I have to Uninstall it because I can't use my Google Play Credits anymore to use for In-game purchases and am not getting any form of answers from the developer. I hope they eventually get it solved. I should be paying Google Play directly and the developer should be getting paid from there. But I keep getting messages saying that I can't pay because I'm in the USA. love the game not this stuff,2,19,7.8.6,2025-04-13 22:19:09

8d92cfea-bb5a-41a8-8032-bf7a06bf3cac,A Google user,Developers on this game could have something here...if not for greed...some of us can't afford to play it and even if I could...it's ridiculously expensive to do so...smh to excessive greed. Don't even attempt this if your can't afford it. These games might be great for Seniors but not to what it will cost you. I liked this game but I simply can't afford the money required.

I left after a game to be sure, because this has happened a few times now, and now I lost again. Been playing this new game dynamic where you have to pair up a rainbow ball with a booster for 2 days coz I don't wanna pay to win, but that's the model now. Uninstall.

259e1ec1-55e2-44be-bfec-c2ae80a3097e,michael grosso,Game play is decent. Gave it a 2 star because the cost of everything has gone up. From the season pass to just a handful of coins. Sounds like someone is getting greedy. Edit: came back to lower it to a one star as it has become pay to play at this point. you can't beat certain levels without spending money,1,10,7.8.6,2025-04-09 05:45:46

I reached out to their useless customer support and followed their advise only for my previous complaint to disappear and I make another followup again. But nothing was resolved.

I understand levels are made to get progressively harder and challenging but this has become unrealistic.

The mini game is better than the main quest but it's ridiculous the amount of energy it takes to play. On the game for 3 CLICKS every 5 hours. 😔 I started spending money to see if helps. Each mini game REQUIRES between 40 & 60 USD to beat the levels. It's important to know the prize is a lawn ornament. The mini game is addicting once you get to spend a few minutes playing, you grudgingly give more. If you aren't hooked, RUN!!",3,118,7.8.6,2025-04-07 03:23:00

Scammy button placement for dynamites? if i had 1500 coins i would've misclicked it at least 3 times. i understand money needs to be made but this is not it. i was about to spend money to buy energy at the start of this event actually. now i am leaving with bitter taste in my mouth,1,6,7.8.1,2025-04-06 21:56:31
