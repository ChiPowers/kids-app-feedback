The guild I joined wouldn't make me a guild champion so that I could fight in the guild wars. I eventually got bored with doing the same things over and over again every single day with no real rewards or satisfaction. Hero Wars is like every other turn-based fighting game, with too many side quests and more time spent leveling up your heroes than actually fighting (essentially a rip-off of Final Fantasy).",3,0,,2025-04-17 22:09:29

You never lag. it's fun and addicting. however it takes years to progress after lvl 40. cards are not easy at all to get unless you pay or play ALOT. You finish lvls and gain little for it. you can't even buy certain cards you have to wait an pray for an event. WAY TO MUCH REPETITION. constantly playing same levels to get equipment wasting energy required to try to progress in the campaign. can't play when I want to without paying money. 1 star greed is a sin.,1,1747,1.240.000,2025-04-17 19:31:43

You shouldn't disrespect them.. You should give an understanding and helpful response if you want others to download and play your games..

The advertisement I saw was gameplay that wasnt even in the game. I played about 6hr and never saw it (roughly level 20+). Not a terrible game but heavily monitization, lack of character animations, low quality of life features, paywalls to get access to content, and false advertisement turned me off to it.

The game developers make money from you downloading the game already and don't need to put ads in to support the studio despite the developers lying to you. Games like this take only a few hours of work and are very inexpensive to make roughly $100 usd or less. SKIP DOWNLOADING THIS GAME. EDIT: No i won't be leaving feedback in-game.

The campaign is neat but could be longer. Events make up for it as it gives you rare chances to upgrade certain characters related to the event. The ads are sadly fake and do not represent the game. Huge problem is the micro transactions. The game is spamming/forcing you to pay for everything. There is no gameplay. Recent events are stupid.,2,95,1.229.200,2025-02-09 07:14:23

I don't know if the game ensures that players who paid money always win but there is some cheating going down. You can have a team with full stars fighting against a team of all 3 stars and YOU will loose. What's the point of upgrading my star power if I'm gonna get clapped by under leveled dudes who have no business wiping my team on the draft.,3,1,1.228.100,2025-01-29 11:18:47

But, if you don't drag your feet through starting the game, then the tutorial phase makes things unplayable. I'm currently unable to move on because the tutorial is telling me to enhance something I've already enhanced, and the only way for me to do it any more is by paying real-world money. I can't skip or back out, and if I close the game to reopen it, the tutorial immediately hijacks the game to drag me right back to the paywall.",1,261,1.227.000,2024-12-28 22:14:40

Community managers on discord stated that the people making the game had no plans to change anything so I guess player feedback doesn't matter to the Hwa team. Un-installed 12/24/24 and started playing web version that same day. So far no crashes. Able to send letters to Winter Claus and send presents to friends via Winterfest.
