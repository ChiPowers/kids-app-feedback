Also LOVE the kids safe design and that there isn't an unnecessary ad every 5 seconds. I don't think there are any actually but we just downloaded this so I cant say that for sure. Educational games that are actually fun are always a win but so hard to find.. I definitely recommend.",5,155,5.3.18,2025-05-01 10:55:43

Fun games and my kid LOVES your work but several of them just freeze on the iPad so I don't know what to do or how to contact you guys to let you know there's the food truck app on the iPad 2018 version that won't let you pick a meal to make. There's the dinosaur app which won't let you go back to home screen. I would really ask that you to thorough retesting at least on the iPad of at least those two games but all the game to make sure all screens work on ipad because it is buggy thx,3,6,5.3.13,2025-01-08 08:49:16

bfae1540-d9f4-4471-b54e-79cc072cec10,A Google user,My 5 and 10 year olds love watching PBS kids and their games add a whole new fun element to his favorite shows. The only changes I would make would be the ability to cancel downloads. They can sometimes accidentally tap a game as they are scrolling and have a few downloading at a time. It would also be great to have the ability to uninstall individual games instead of having to delete all the games. Overall the PBS Kids games app is a household favorite.,5,411,5.1.2,2024-10-24 06:13:30

You can play fashion games or slime games and more. That's why you should download PBS because your kids can have a fun and educational game at the same time.,5,60,5.3.4,2024-09-14 10:30:31

Cons: significant oversight with the grownups tab having no PW lock in place, even while in Samsung kids. This allows kids to delete games from storage and to be able to change the amount of gb allowed to be downloaded shift from less than 1 GB to up to 5 GB. Biggest issue is kids can switch from cellular data to wifi easily, resulting in kids using up cellular data without realizing it.",2,14,4.4.3,2024-04-12 15:46:34

Reminds me of a study that showed kids IQs actually were lower if they had watched Sesame Street growing up than TV intended for adults. Edutainment is a pejorative that describes faux educational materials that are really just entertainment and describes the games here perfectly. If you want to keep your kid entertained without totally melting their brains, you're probably better off letting them play Doom! üòÇ",1,0,,2024-03-07 10:18:18

There is a maximum amount of games it will allow you to keep at one time, but you can't choose WHICH ones to keep or get rid of. The only option is to erase ALL of them and start over with none, if your kid decides they want to try a new one that they don't have yet. Either getting rid of the cap on the number of games, or at least giving an option to manage which games to keep would be nice.",4,112,4.2.6,2023-05-30 11:02:13

We closed the game and tried doing it again with a different order . It's a different order alright but still can't make it bc it has no coins . Very frustrating for my 3yo.

I predicted you would change the logo in July, and I got it right, so I started last-minute binging, and got a taste of the rebrand, before finally saying farewell in early August 2022 because I was too old for PBS Kids.

They seem to be faded like they're not downloaded or able to be played. Only a handful of games work. Wondering if the problem is on our side or the game's side. Please help us fix this problem because our three year old really enjoys playing the games that DO work. Thanks!,2,18,,2021-12-10 10:41:35

For instance the Sesame Street marble race game. The first run, before you add the third ramp works, but on the second run, after adding the third ramp, clicking the marbel makes the chime sound but nothing happens. It works on the rare occasion, but mostly doesn't. Many other games will freeze. Using it on a Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+.",4,584,3.3.2,2021-10-11 13:44:37

In less than 15 minutes my 6 yr old used 250 MB of data or $4. I'm not certain what she did, but I'm guessing it's because it doesn't install any games but they can be downloaded by kids at anytime. So I removed it from any device that has cell until there's an option not to use cell. It would get a 5, but any app intended for kids shouldn't allow them to spend so much money, even if it's through data usage.",1,103,2.7.6,2021-05-16 13:22:26

The IOS version runs better for my family than the android version on my Asus Zenpad. There are a number of games and variety of games for many PBS Kids shows. Glitchy games make it in as well. Those frustrate my son quite a bit. He loves the Wild Kratts and many of the shows and games and has learned quite a bit from app. I give it 4 stars.,4,110,2.7.7,2021-05-13 20:19:47

It work a little bit mostly worked on it. I got a i guess you can say smart tv,i set up live tv and am watching right now. This game is so good but if i hace games on it that i got will go away the next day. And hide and Seek games make it easy to find them and with be challenging to find them in real life.

This game is amazing. I want to give it 5 stars. It's amazing, but storage issue is a deal breaker. It makes me want to cancel my donation to PBS.

Currently, there is a typo in the name and the letter 'f' is missing from the word 'shift.' My little one can't read yet, and only plays with my supervision, so it doesn't directly affect me.

That is 3 on two tablets....so I guess it has been 6 times...That wouldn't be a problem if it were a normal game. You have to re down load every game. It takes hours!!! My kids freak out.
