Also LOVE the kids safe design and that there isn't an unnecessary ad every 5 seconds. I don't think there are any actually but we just downloaded this so I cant say that for sure. Educational games that are actually fun are always a win but so hard to find.. I definitely recommend.",5,155,5.3.18,2025-05-01 10:55:43

Fun games and my kid LOVES your work but several of them just freeze on the iPad so I don't know what to do or how to contact you guys to let you know there's the food truck app on the iPad 2018 version that won't let you pick a meal to make. There's the dinosaur app which won't let you go back to home screen. I would really ask that you to thorough retesting at least on the iPad of at least those two games but all the game to make sure all screens work on ipad because it is buggy thx,3,6,5.3.13,2025-01-08 08:49:16

bfae1540-d9f4-4471-b54e-79cc072cec10,A Google user,My 5 and 10 year olds love watching PBS kids and their games add a whole new fun element to his favorite shows. The only changes I would make would be the ability to cancel downloads. They can sometimes accidentally tap a game as they are scrolling and have a few downloading at a time. It would also be great to have the ability to uninstall individual games instead of having to delete all the games. Overall the PBS Kids games app is a household favorite.,5,411,5.1.2,2024-10-24 06:13:30

You can play fashion games or slime games and more. That's why you should download PBS because your kids can have a fun and educational game at the same time.,5,60,5.3.4,2024-09-14 10:30:31

Cons: significant oversight with the grownups tab having no PW lock in place, even while in Samsung kids. This allows kids to delete games from storage and to be able to change the amount of gb allowed to be downloaded shift from less than 1 GB to up to 5 GB. Biggest issue is kids can switch from cellular data to wifi easily, resulting in kids using up cellular data without realizing it.",2,14,4.4.3,2024-04-12 15:46:34

Only problem i have is that you're supposed to be able to play the games you've already downloaded OFFLINE. It's only allowed my child to play offline once and that was only 3 games. The 20+ other games downloaded won't show up. All other times i open the app offline and it just stays on the loading screen. Even tried letting it sit there for 30 minutes but just stayed on loading screen,4,488,4.3.8,2024-01-24 11:15:33

Mr. Ratburn and Patrick are part of the game and their lifestyle is painted as completely normal when it isn't. Yeah, it's such an adorable game but this is how PBS works to indoctrinate small children. I'm also not impressed with them having Ratburn's wedding on the Arthur website every single May. I love Arthur (and even Ratburn and Patrick, who I revise in my fan art to be friendly neighbors) but PBS uses cute characters in evil ways. Ugh.",2,3,,2023-01-10 13:22:51

We closed the game and tried doing it again with a different order . It's a different order alright but still can't make it bc it has no coins . Very frustrating for my 3yo.

c9f06ff7-ac68-451c-8103-704751fbd4ec,A Google user,"Garbage game made by incompetent developers. My son pays it on a galaxy a7 (T285). tablet has 8 gigs of flash storage. The game has a ""parents"" section that isn't password protected (only a MORON would not lock down a parental control section even with a rudamentary pin or password option). The parents section has a storage limiter option that does precisely nothing. The app constantly fills the storage completely rendering the device useless inside a week necessitating a factory reset (seriously, I cant even open the settings apps because the game eats every byte of storage) And finally, the app will not allow me to move it to an sd card... who the hell thinks this app is good??? pretty sure all the positive reviews are bots.",1,11,3.4.9,2022-05-03 18:20:54

They seem to be faded like they're not downloaded or able to be played. Only a handful of games work. Wondering if the problem is on our side or the game's side. Please help us fix this problem because our three year old really enjoys playing the games that DO work. Thanks!,2,18,,2021-12-10 10:41:35

For instance the Sesame Street marble race game. The first run, before you add the third ramp works, but on the second run, after adding the third ramp, clicking the marbel makes the chime sound but nothing happens. It works on the rare occasion, but mostly doesn't. Many other games will freeze. Using it on a Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+.",4,584,3.3.2,2021-10-11 13:44:37

In less than 15 minutes my 6 yr old used 250 MB of data or $4. I'm not certain what she did, but I'm guessing it's because it doesn't install any games but they can be downloaded by kids at anytime. So I removed it from any device that has cell until there's an option not to use cell. It would get a 5, but any app intended for kids shouldn't allow them to spend so much money, even if it's through data usage.",1,103,2.7.6,2021-05-16 13:22:26

f7f9c8fc-7e37-40f4-b1bd-62785d0a0b54,A Google user,Stability of the pbs kids game app has improved over years but is still somewhat unstable causing freezes and crashing during some games. The IOS version runs better for my family than the android version on my Asus Zenpad. There are a number of games and variety of games for many PBS Kids shows. Glitchy games make it in as well. Those frustrate my son quite a bit. He loves the Wild Kratts and many of the shows and games and has learned quite a bit from app. I give it 4 stars.,4,110,2.7.7,2021-05-13 20:19:47

The games take up space fast and the storage can't be changed to external, so if you don't have a 64GB+ storage device you'll have to keep limits low or constantly prune games for your kids.

Have tried on many devices (multiple phone's and tablets some of which are brand new) so I know the issues on their end not mine. But it takes forever to download any game they want to play into the app. If they click more then one there is no way to unclick them and it takes forever to download IF it even does usually not.,2,53,2.5.3,2021-03-11 10:52:21

You have to download the each game and this app refuses to store any data on an SD card. Meaning this one single game has used ALL of the storage on my daughter's tablet, and completely disabled it. This game is amazing. I want to give it 5 stars. It's amazing, but storage issue is a deal breaker. It makes me want to cancel my donation to PBS.

Cons-take too long to load once inside the game, once you choose activity you have to wait for that to download. Then you have a long loading for the activity to start, if it starts, some activties didn't load, just a blank screen with X in the top right corner. Not sure witch characters activity will be age appropriate for 1 & 2yr olds.",1,335,2.3.0,2020-04-09 10:06:05

That is 3 on two tablets....so I guess it has been 6 times...That wouldn't be a problem if it were a normal game. You have to re down load every game. It takes hours!!! My kids freak out. It is a big deal. Fix it and I will give you 5 because my kids love the games.,2,843,2.2.0,2020-01-25 21:11:10
