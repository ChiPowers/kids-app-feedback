I wish i can find my mgo friends on facebook but it's super hard with just first name and a picture. I have a few friends I would love to talk. that's beside the fact that they can change their mgo name. Please make it accessible so we can communicate/chat with our gaming friends.

But what a game it absolutely great day after day well actually some day im on two three times. So it is truly a one in a kind monopoly game.

dbab6f04-7964-41fb-8972-a8ac2c47fe6f,A Google user,Like so many of the other reviewers have stated I used to enjoy the game but now it is only a frustration as it is obvious that the game is set up with odds against you to force you to pay if you HOPE to achieve any level of success. It has gotten so bad that I no longer even consider paying because it is NEVER enough. The new Community Chest is the nail in the coffin for me. Now your Community Chest Partners suffer too if you don't have the dice to achieve the goals.,1,0,1.50.0,2025-07-25 09:32:14

Example if your a higher level, your offer is LESS then someone else. Monopoly is offering me 12.3 dice for 99.00 but someone i know is being offered 19k for the same exact offer. Their explanation is my style of play. What the hell does that have to do with a lower player. If you are offering deals they should be the same for each paying or playing customer.",1,2,1.50.0,2025-07-24 18:00:41

I've played since the beginning and it's gotten worse and worse. from stealing dice, to reducing the amount of cards in packs, to boring events that are constantly running. I would never recommend this game to anyone I know. Unless you spend heavily you'll never compete in any events. You used to have a shot in the racing game but now with the ball and chain and matching up against huge spenders, it's not even worth it. Unless you're first the prizes all suck.

I spent 2 hours a day trying to win an event that started. didnt even make it close with over 1500 spins a day. my friend who is playing beside me does a bank raid and gets 1000$ on her phone. but it takes away 1 million out of my bank. it's just frustrating. also if you land on something with a multiplier it doesn't give you the money most of the time even though it says you won it. you just get the base amount minus the multiplier.,3,0,1.49.2,2025-07-22 01:48:21

Because I noticed that every game event whenever the time is almost up like there's <3 hours left. The game will start to purposely make you lose and barely give you any wins after that. Can you guys fix that for all the games? Because it's a little too obvious that all the dice. The pieces will hit before or after the target slot that we need.

I think we need more then 5 cards a day. hope that changes,3,0,1.49.1,2025-07-17 14:41:01

This is a predatory app that shoves purchases at you every chance it can, for the mental equivalent of dangling keys for entertainment. The graphics are slick, but that's really the only positive.",2,0,,2025-07-17 02:42:44

This game is fixed every role of the dice is predetermined there are no random numbers being generated. I wouldn't be surprised if a class action lawsuit was in the near future. A company that made over 2 Billion That's Billion with a B. Dollars last year on only microtransactions.

This also depends on which gold cards are picked to be exchanged. There should be a period where you can exchange any of the gold cards ford gold cards, especially towards the end of the event. Just a suggestion. I have had sets close, only needing 2-3 gold cards, and sitting on 9‚Äê15 duplicate gold cards (which turn out to be useless)",3,0,1.49.0,2025-07-12 03:06:39

It is frustrating to win any of the stickers or tokens you need a lot of dice. As long as you know you are not in control you can just play for fun. Do not expect to win anything. It is what it is.

After spending my hard earned cash on the game and playing for a number of years now my eyes have been opened to their downfall. They are banning players many players for no reason and offering no support to players when seeking help in the matter.

When trading, it's sometimes difficult to rely on the other user you're trading with. For instance, you're only allowed 5 trades a day. Let's say you're at 4/5 trades, & you only need 1 more sticker to complete the set to receive the award of dice (250- 1,500). Find a tradeable user to exchange, send. They don't accept/decline. This leaves you at 5/5 trades & no way to cancel. CHANGE THAT !",4,2,1.48.1,2025-07-08 21:52:11

The tasks are hard for some of us to complete unrealistic amounts to land on those spaces unless you got thousands of dice. I am not paying money for this game its fun but starting to want to delete game due to things pushing you towards having to spend money to win things.

Unresolved ongoing issue with Tycoon benefits on Android devices. Pro: They've updated to include ability to play with friends without forcing Facebook connection.

I also wish you could opt out of the pop ups when you open the game I have to get past 4-6 game related ads (half if not all of which cost money),3,6,1.48.1,2025-07-06 20:32:12

Last season only for 1 card the Album was not complete. Because of this stupid randomizer during Mega Heist never comes during bigger dice numbers. My almost 800 Dice got wasted but no Shut down or Heist came. I and my friends will be uninstalling the game after this season. The game purposely does this to make you buy. I am NOT going to buy anything in this game. We will shift.,2,4,1.48.1,2025-07-05 10:03:28

One of the final tasks is to roll double 4 x70 times, and as far as odds go, you'd have a 1/36 chance to roll double 4. On paper, it would cost a little over 2000 dice to complete, but the luck factor makes this feel impossible since you have to blindly roll and hope that you get double 4s. It can cost 4k-10K+ dice if im unlucky. I don't know if my partners can afford this all season",3,3,1.48.1,2025-07-04 03:11:00

I'm on level 267 and it's cost almost 40 billion to complete the level. and the price goes up more with each level.. good app but it will start to get boring as they tend to constantly repeat stickers that it rewards.

I've played almost every day during the star wars season just to get nowhere and not finish most of the albums because of how the game is set up and the fact that they don't guarantee non duplicate stickers amazes me. Don't waste your time on a game that is basically like gambling for old people. They don't even try to hide the fact that it's rigged.,1,0,1.48.1,2025-06-29 10:47:23

Complaining you have to spend money! No you don't. That's your choice. I'm retired and have no money to spend. But I'm on it four to five times a day. No frustration because it's a game.

5ae8bfe9-2e01-4852-bd5e-5bd275d16a03,A Google user,game is programmed to not give you items or stickers. game is just used to make money through trickery and manipulative practices. been playing for years and never competed any side games or a sticker collection. This is a pay to win game and even then it is no guarantee that you will win the side games or sticker collections. you all should be ashamed of yourselves for how this game runs and the way it operates deceptively. I am done with this joke of a game and you shady practices. disgusting,1,0,1.48.1,2025-06-28 12:44:47

And in some of the individual games you get hardly any pieces to play. For example in one game you only get 2 or 3 pieces to play and then you have to earn more but you can spend hours playing the game before you are able to get another 2 or 3 pieces. Edited on 6/26/2025 There are still 5 days left to collect stickers and I am not getting any new stickers. The Monopoly Bank board should be mostly new stickers.",3,3,1.47.5,2025-06-26 12:49:17

I have a couple suggestions, though, first I hate waiting an hour for seventeen free rolls, which means you are lucky to get eight rolls before waiting another hour just to repeat the same play. In the actual game, when you rolled a double, you got free rolls, on your third free roll if you threw another double you went to jail. ""Get out of jail for free card?"" Pass ‚ÄùGo‚Äù and get 200 free rolls?",5,0,1.47.5,2025-06-24 16:49:46

55161c91-9865-4fd0-bb3a-7a3104006216,Dameon Rippy,My initial review was a 5 ‚≠ê a couple years ago. Now it seems like everything is pay to play and no matter how many times you buy or open packs you seem to not get new stickers. Why have full gold albums if only 3 days to trade 6 cards. Makes no sense. You can trade 5 stickers a day. How about a day or few that you can trade up to 5 gold ones of your choice. I'm sure no money will be missed and everyone will continue like normal with a better chance at winning. Hoping for some changes.,2,1,1.47.5,2025-06-24 04:33:45

Please fix this issue and I will give it more stars.,2,1,1.47.5,2025-06-23 20:11:14

When the spins give you the minimum, or don't give me nothing. You guys just want us to spend money. Ain't about all that",1,4,1.47.5,2025-06-23 18:55:54

All the extra stickers that I had to trade are gone. It had to be glitch because someone sent me a sticker that I never requested.,1,1,1.47.5,2025-06-23 18:10:57

e4ac38a0-78a4-4381-aca3-65bd0972b587,Liah Soko≈Çowicz,"When the game is good, it's great. But when it sucks, it's awful. Especially the daily rewards. I miss out on SO many of them because the game will want me to either complete a shutdown or a bank heist, but every railroad I land on is the opposite one I need. And I do mean every single one. So many days I've missed out on my rewards because I just wouldn't get the one I needed. Several hundred dice rolled and nada. I think that's completely unfair.",2,0,,2025-06-23 17:09:20
