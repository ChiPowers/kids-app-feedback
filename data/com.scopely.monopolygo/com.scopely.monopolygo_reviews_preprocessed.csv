I spent 2 hours a day trying to win an event that started. didnt even make it close with over 1500 spins a day. my friend who is playing beside me does a bank raid and gets 1000$ on her phone. but it takes away 1 million out of my bank. it's just frustrating. also if you land on something with a multiplier it doesn't give you the money most of the time even though it says you won it. you just get the base amount minus the multiplier.,3,0,1.49.2,2025-07-22 01:48:21,486,0.7096,sadness,85.28481859410434,False,False,-1,0.0,,Unknown,False

Because I noticed that every game event whenever the time is almost up like there's <3 hours left. The game will start to purposely make you lose and barely give you any wins after that. Can you guys fix that for all the games? Because it's a little too obvious that all the dice. The pieces will hit before or after the target slot that we need.

55161c91-9865-4fd0-bb3a-7a3104006216,Dameon Rippy,My initial review was a 5 ⭐ a couple years ago. Now it seems like everything is pay to play and no matter how many times you buy or open packs you seem to not get new stickers. Why have full gold albums if only 3 days to trade 6 cards. Makes no sense. You can trade 5 stickers a day. How about a day or few that you can trade up to 5 gold ones of your choice. I'm sure no money will be missed and everyone will continue like normal with a better chance at winning. Hoping for some changes.,2,1,1.47.5,2025-06-24 04:33:45,489,0.914,neutral,88.48003094059406,False,False,1,0.821586643712872,1.0,sticker collection and trading,True
